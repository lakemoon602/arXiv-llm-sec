While researchers have proposed text-based differencing\ntechniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing\nmethods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that\noperate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in\ndevelopers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or\nduplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent\nsuch block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling\ndevelopers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the\nefficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a\ntext-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of\nblock-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional\ndifferencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all\npossible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres\nalgorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size\nof the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's\nintent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five\nstate-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines\nand adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their\nperformance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental\nresults show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than\nbaseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our\nexperiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks\nregarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime\nefficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool."}
