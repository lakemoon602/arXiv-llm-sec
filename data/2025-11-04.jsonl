However, best-intended practices for conducting empirical studies\nhave not yet well established. In this paper, based on the primary studies\nidentified from the latest systematic literature review on quantum optimization\nfor software engineering problems, we conducted a systematic analysis on these\nstudies from various aspects including experimental designs, hyperparameter\nsettings, case studies, baselines, tooling, and metrics. We identify key gaps\nin the current practices such as limited reporting of the number of\nrepetitions, number of shots, and inadequate consideration of noise handling,\nas well as a lack of standardized evaluation protocols such as the adoption of\nquality metrics, especially quantum-specific metrics. Based on our analysis, we\nprovide insights for designing empirical studies and highlight the need for\nmore real-world and open case studies to assess cost-effectiveness and\npractical utility of the three types of approaches: quantum-inspired, quantum,\nand hybrid. This study is intended to offer an overview of current practices\nand serve as an initial reference for designing and conducting empirical\nstudies on evaluating and comparing quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid\nalgorithms in solving optimization problems in software engineering."}

We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative\nassessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o,\nDeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon\nH1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the\nresponses. Results show that Random Forest has the best detection model, and\nChatGPT-o3 outperformed DeepSeek-R1 in attack analysis and mitigation."}

We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models\ntrained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} -\nconsistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on\nsequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are\nmethodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to\nspatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,\nand in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization."}

In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling.

Spatial\nnormalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,\nbut often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when\nlocalization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted\nbrain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between\nindividuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)\nlearns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from\nmulti-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive\nobjectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to\nregion-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a\ntransformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of\nchannels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal\nganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording\nsessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space\nsupports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,\nregion-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The\ntransformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or\nsupervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of\nmasked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.\nTogether, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject\naggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task\nstructure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable."}

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

Bogdan contributed equally to this work, and\n  their listed order was determined by coinflip", "summary": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD."}

To\nensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which\nare then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer\nconsensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints.
