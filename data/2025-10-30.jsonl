This paper\nintroduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for\nsurfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and\nreceived. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through\ntwenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to\nreveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced\nauthority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:\ndiagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction\nover foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural\nrequirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts\nlanguage models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable\nartifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS\nbundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.\nA key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit\nbreaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based\non judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage\nProtocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link\nactivation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and\npluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into\nmodel architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite\noperates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as\nsafeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between\nperformance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while\nmaintaining epistemic modesty."}

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally.

With the widespread adoption of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been\nleveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation.

However, we find many reasoning\nsteps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we\nhighlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be\ndecorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution.

In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur.

To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should\nmake rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,\nwithout blocking advanced experimentation.

This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision.

The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills.

The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line\nenergization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through\nde-energizations while reducing load shedding.

For a particular power system, OPS\ninstances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire\nrisks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine\nLearning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across\ninstances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly\nproduces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided\nMILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of\nenergized and de-energized lines.

Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening.

Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism.

While their applications in computational fluid\ndynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural\nproblems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the\nGraph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate\nmodeling of dynamic structural problems.\n  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine\nlearning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic\nsimulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in\nnode-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in\nfinite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,\nwhich reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a\nwavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.\n  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz\nHanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the\nphysics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen\nloading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful\npredictions.\n  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial\ninference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is\nthis the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it\navoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for\nexplanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a\nquestion to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to\nderive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove\nthat conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled\nreasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided\nVariational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned\nreasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning.
