During\ndisasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often\ndeviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.\nHowever, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or\nspecific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization\ncapability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and\nunpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior\nexperience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility\ngeneration that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a\nuniversal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster\ntypes and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose\na unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named\nUniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed\nprompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common\npatterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation\nprocess. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning\nframework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through\nshared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.\nExtensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate\nthat our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving\nan average performance improvement exceeding 13%."}

However, these roles were\noften poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and\nintegration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of\nreinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods\nand computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective\nplanning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a\nsecond-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks,\ngaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery.\nThese insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining\ntargeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided\nwalkthroughs.

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives.

Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance.

However, their performance is\ncritically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper\nselection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur\nsignificant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To\naddress this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that\nintegrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density\nEstimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first\nemploys a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral\ndistribution of a given GEP.

Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI\nsolver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems.

Methods: This study combines Social-Technical\nGrounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software\nengineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants.\nWe compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of\nNeurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance.\nResults: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled\nin logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and\nthey enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related\ntechnologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written\ncommunication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in\ninteracting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing\nwork by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software\nengineers."}

Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental\nqualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,\nPhenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an\nensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,\ninformation power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal\nscale and used as input features.

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

In this work, we propose the\nQuantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework\nthat integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.\nThe framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that\njointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)\nquantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and\nmitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients.

In particular, we use logic in a\nneurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the\nneural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic\nAI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are\nsatisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction\napproaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a\nframework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural\nnetworks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various\nexisting approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how\nlogical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we\nreview some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for\nneural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our\nframework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic\nencoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind."}

Our method is tailored to overcome the unique\nchallenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and\nhandling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified\nconvolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an\nautoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We\nevaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA\narchive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as\nnon-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among\nante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with\nnon-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable\nresults accessible to domain experts."}

However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels.

Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in\nimproving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over\nnoisy and fading multiple-access channels."}

Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

Under Review", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available. %We release an open-source implementation to support\ncontinued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning."}
