However, truly personalized support requires access to meaningful Learning Context (LC) regarding who the learner is, what they are trying to understand, and how they are engaging with the material. In this paper, we present a framework for measuring and diagnosing how the LC influences instructional strategy selection in LLM-based tutoring systems. Using psychometrically grounded synthetic learning contexts and a pedagogically grounded decision space, we compare LLM instructional decisions in context-blind and context-aware conditions and quantify their alignment with the pedagogical judgments of subject matter experts. Our results show that, while providing the LC induces systematic, measurable changes in instructional decisions that move LLM policies closer to the subject matter expert policy, substantial misalignment remains. To diagnose this misalignment, we introduce a relevance-impact analysis that reveals which learner characteristics are attended to, ignored, or spuriously influential in LLM instructional decision-making. This analysis, conducted in collaboration with subject matter experts, demonstrates that LC materially shapes LLM instructional planning but does not reliably induce pedagogically appropriate personalization. Our results enable principled evaluation of context-aware LLM systems and provide a foundation for improving personalization through learner characteristic prioritization, pedagogical model tuning, and LC engineering."}

Prior research has largely examined these forces in isolation, yet it remains unclear to what extent supply meets demand. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of a unique dataset of 1.1 million fact-checks and fact-checking requests from X's Community Notes platform between June 2024 and May 2025. We find that requests disproportionately target highly visible posts - those with more views and engagement and authored by influential accounts - whereas fact-checks are distributed more broadly across languages, sentiments, and topics. Using a quasi-experimental survival analysis, we further estimate the effect of displaying requests on subsequent note creation. Results show that requests significantly accelerate contributions from Top Writers. Altogether, our findings highlight a gap between the content that attracts requests for fact-checking and the content that ultimately receives fact-checks, while showing that user requests can steer contributors toward greater alignment. These insights carry important implications for platform governance and future research on online misinformation."}

The application context concerns an industry-academia collaboration project between PUC-Rio and EXA, a Brazilian cybersecurity company. For evaluation purposes, we applied questionnaires assessing RefineML's suitability and overall acceptance and semi-structured interviews. We applied thematic analysis to the collected qualitative data. Regarding suitability and acceptance, the results of the questionnaires indicated high perceived usefulness and intention to use. Based on the interviews, stakeholders perceived RefineML as improving communication and facilitating early feasibility assessments, as well as enabling dual-track governance of ML and software work, allowing continuous refinement of the model while evolving the overall software project.

We present a framework for generating and evaluating large-scale isomorphic physics problem banks using Generative AI to enable asynchronous, multi-attempt assessments. Isomorphic problems test identical concepts through varied surface features and contexts, providing richer variation than conventional parameterized questions while maintaining consistent difficulty. Our generation framework employs prompt chaining and tool use to achieve precise control over structural variations (numeric values, spatial relations) alongside diverse contextual variations. For pre-deployment validation, we evaluate generated items using 17 open-source language models (LMs) (0.6B-32B) and compare against actual student performance (N>200) across three midterm exams. Results show that 73% of deployed banks achieve statistically homogeneous difficulty, and LMs pattern correlate strongly with student performance (Pearson's $ρ$ up to 0.594). Additionally, LMs successfully identify problematic variants, such as ambiguous problem texts. Model scale also proves critical for effective validation, where extremely small (<4B) and large (>14B) models exhibit floor and ceiling effects respectively, making mid-sized models optimal for detecting difficulty outliers."}

This paper presents a qualitative sociotechnical audit of Polymarket (N = 27), combining digital ethnography, interpretive walkthroughs, and semi-structured interviews to examine how probabilistic authority is produced and contested. We introduce the concept of Prediction Laundering, drawing on MacFarlanes framework of knowledge transmission, to describe how subjective, high-uncertainty bets, strategic hedges, and capital-heavy whale activity are stripped of their original noise through algorithmic aggregation. We trace a four-stage laundering lifecycle: Structural Sanitization, where a centralized ontology scripts the bet-able future; Probabilistic Flattening, which collapses heterogeneous motives into a single signal; Architectural Masking, which conceals capital-driven influence behind apparent consensus; and Epistemic Hardening, which erases governance disputes to produce an objective historical fact. We show that this process induces epistemic vertigo and accountability gaps by offloading truth-resolution to off-platform communities such as Discord. Challenging narratives of frictionless collective intelligence, we demonstrate Epistemic Stratification, in which technical elites audit underlying mechanisms while the broader public consumes a sanitized, capital-weighted signal, and we conclude by advocating Friction-Positive Design that surfaces the social and financial frictions inherent in synthetic truth production."}

Social bot detection algorithms have been developed to help identify these bot agents efficiently. While such algorithms can help mitigate the harmful effects of social media bots, they operate within complex socio-technical systems that include users and organizations. As such, ethical considerations are key while developing and deploying these bot detection algorithms, especially at scales as massive as social media ecosystems. In this article, we examine the ethical implications for social bot detection systems through three pillars: training datasets, algorithm development, and the use of bot agents. We do so by surveying the training datasets of existing bot detection algorithms, evaluating existing bot detection datasets, and drawing on discussions of user experiences of people being detected as bots. This examination is grounded in the FATe framework, which examines Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in consideration of tech ethics. We then elaborate on the challenges that researchers face in addressing ethical issues with bot detection and provide recommendations for research directions. We aim for this preliminary discussion to inspire more responsible and equitable approaches towards improving the social media bot detection landscape."}

Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review]."}

Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily \"abnormal\" or rare."}

This paper presents an approach to the automatic detection of sexually explicit content in Spanish-language song lyrics by fine-tuning a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model on a curated corpus of 100 songs, evenly divided between expert-labeled explicit and non-explicit categories. The proposed methodology leverages transfer learning to adapt the pre-trained model to the idiosyncratic linguistic features of urban Latin music, including slang, metaphors, and culturally specific double entendres that evade conventional dictionary-based filtering systems. Experimental evaluation on held-out test sets demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves 87% accuracy, 100% precision, and 100% specificity after a feedback-driven refinement loop, outperforming both its pre-feedback configuration and a non-customized baseline ChatGPT model. A comparative analysis reveals that the fine-tuned model agrees with expert human classification in 59.2% of cases versus 55.1% for the standard model, confirming that domain-specific adaptation enhances sensitivity to implicit and culturally embedded sexual references. These findings support the viability of deploying fine-tuned large language models as automated content moderation tools on music streaming platforms. Building on these technical results, the paper develops a public policy proposal for a multi-tier age-based content rating system for music analogous to the PEGI system for video games analyzed through the PESTEL framework and Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, establishing both the technological feasibility and the policy pathway for systematic music content regulation."}

Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR.

As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks."}

In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development."}

While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length."}

Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios."}

This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose Cve2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \\textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \\textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that Cve2PoC achieves 82.9\\% and 54.3\\% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3\\% and 20.4\\%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability."}

Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity."}

However, recent studies have shown that FSSL is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks are limited by their trigger design, which typically employs a global, uniform trigger that is easily detected, gets diluted during aggregation, and lacks robustness in heterogeneous client environments. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Driven multi-party Collusion Attack (ADCA). During local pre-training, malicious clients decompose the global trigger to find optimal local patterns. Subsequently, these malicious clients collude to form a malicious coalition and establish a collaborative optimization mechanism within it. In this mechanism, each submits its model updates, and an attention mechanism dynamically aggregates them to explore the best cooperative strategy. The resulting aggregated parameters serve as the initial state for the next round of training within the coalition, thereby effectively mitigating the dilution of backdoor information by benign updates. Experiments on multiple FSSL scenarios and four datasets show that ADCA significantly outperforms existing methods in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and persistence, proving its effectiveness and robustness."}

Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. The code will be available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/TurboBoA."}

This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics."}

Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning."}

An Exactly Solvable Model", "comment": null, "summary": "A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \\textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers."}
