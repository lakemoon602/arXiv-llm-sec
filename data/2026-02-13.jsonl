An empirical experience and a practical solution", "comment": "Please cite the version of ICDEL", "summary": "The check-in service is often provided as an incentive system by online learning platforms to help users establish a learning routine and achieve accomplishment. However, according to the questionnaire conducted in this study, 82.5% of users of online English learning platforms that feature a check-in service have failed to maintain the daily check-in behavior for long-term language learning, mainly by reason of demotivation, forgetfulness, boredom, and insufficient time. As a language learner, I have an empirical experience in maintaining a record of over 4,000 daily check-ins on China's leading online English learning platform of Shanbay. In the meantime, I have been constantly exploring a practical solution to help cultivate perseverance for other users to follow through the learning routine. In this paper, I systematically introduce this practical solution, the GILT method, and its instructions. The experience and solution for perseverance development are based on Shanbay, but they can be applied to other learning platforms for different purposes."}

Unsurprisingly, GenAI tools proliferate kitsch in the hands of amateurs and hobbyists, but various shortcomings also induce kitsch into a more ambitious, professional artists' production with GenAI. I explore them in this paper. Following the introductory outline of digital kitsch and AI art, I review GenAI artworks that manifest five interrelated types of kitsch-engendering expressive flaws: the superficial foregrounding or faulty circumvention of generative models' formal signatures, the feeble critique of AI, the mimetics, and the unacknowledged poetic similarities, all marked by an overreliance on AI as a cultural signifier. I discuss the normalization of these blunders through GenAI art's good standing within the art world and keen relationship with the AI industry, which contributes to the adulteration of AI discourse and the possible corruption of artistic literacy. In conclusion, I emphasize that recognizing different facets of artists' uncritical embrace of techno-cultural trends, comprehending their functions, and anticipating their unintended effects is crucial for reaching relevance and responsibility in AI art."}

We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide."}

Long before direct system exposure, user expectations are mediated through high-stakes public discourse on social platforms. However, platform-mediated engagement signals (e.g., upvotes) may inadvertently function as a ``credibility proxy,'' potentially stifling critical evaluation.\n  This paper investigates the interplay between social proof and verification timing in online discussions of agentic AI. Analyzing a longitudinal dataset from two distinct Reddit communities with contrasting interaction cultures-r/OpenClaw and r/Moltbook-we operationalize verification cues via reproducible lexical rules and model the ``time-to-first-verification'' using a right-censored survival analysis framework.\n  Our findings reveal a systemic ``Popularity Paradox'': high-visibility discussions in both subreddits experience significantly delayed or entirely absent verification cues compared to low-visibility threads. This temporal lag creates a critical window for ``Narrative Lock-in,'' where early, unverified claims crystallize into collective cognitive biases before evidence-seeking behaviors emerge. We discuss the implications of this ``credibility-by-visibility'' effect for AI safety and propose ``epistemic friction'' as a design intervention to rebalance engagement-driven platforms."}

Language AI - the technologies that underpin widely-used conversational systems such as ChatGPT - could provide major benefits if available in people's native languages, yet most of the world's 7,000+ linguistic communities currently lack access and face persistent digital marginalization. Here we present a global longitudinal analysis of social, economic and infrastructural conditions across languages to assess systemic inequalities in language AI. We first analyze the existence of AI resources for 6003 languages. We find that despite efforts of the community to broaden the reach of language technologies (Bapna et al., 2022; Costa-Jussà et al., 2022), the dominance of a handful of languages is exacerbating disparities on an unprecedented scale, with divides widening exponentially rather than narrowing. Further, we contrast the longitudinal diffusion of AI with that of earlier IT technologies, revealing a distinctive hype-driven pattern of spread. To translate our findings into practical insights and guide prioritization efforts, we introduce the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE), which maps the state of technological, socio-economic, and infrastructural prerequisites for AI deployment across languages. The index highlights communities where capacity exists but remains underutilized, and provides a framework for accelerating more equitable diffusion of language AI.

This has been studied extensively under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) formulation, which reduces the problem to finding some type of Steiner subgraph on a network. Group surveillance like wastewater or aerosol monitoring is a form of mass/pooled testing where samples from multiple individuals are pooled together and tested once for all. While a single negative test clears multiple individuals, a positive test does not reveal the infected individuals in the test pool. We introduce the POOLCASCADEMLE problem in the setting of a network propagation process, where the goal is to find a MLE cascade subgraph which is consistent with the pooled test outcomes. Previous work on reconstruction assumes that the test results are of individuals, i.e., pools of size one, and requires a consistent cascade to connect the positive testing nodes. In POOLCASCADEMLE, a consistent cascade must choose at least one node in each positive pool, adding another combinatorial layer. We show that, under the Independent Cascade (IC) model, POOLCASCADEMLE is NP-hard, and present an approximation algorithm based on a reduction to the Group Steiner Tree problem. We also consider a one-hop version of this problem, in which the disease can spread for one time step after being seeded. We show that even this restricted version is NP-hard, and develop a method using linear programming relaxation and rounding. We evaluate the performance of our methods on real and synthetic contact networks, in terms of missing infection recovery and prevalence estimation. We find that our approach outperforms meaningful baselines which correspond to pools of size one and use state-of-the-art methods."}

These formulations provide representative solutions of the inverse problem and enable a systematic comparison of how different strategies influence the structure of the resulting weighted networks.

However, the foundational \"ground truth\" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience."}

Our system SAFuzz integrates prompt-based behavioral diversification, harness generation with problem-specific oracles, and an LLM-based predictor to enable adaptive resource allocation and dynamic early stopping. Evaluating SAFuzz on CSES algorithmic problems, we improve vulnerability discrimination precision from 77.9% to 85.7% and achieve a 1.71x reduction in time cost compared to SOTA GreenFuzz while maintaining comparable recall.

Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case."}

At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\\% of the container baseline. Empirical results demonstrate that SWE-MiniSandbox achieves evaluation performance comparable to standard container-based pipelines.

Existing backdoor attacks on code models face a fundamental trade-off between transferability and stealthiness. Static trigger-based attacks insert fixed dead code patterns that transfer well across models and datasets but are easily detected by code-specific defenses. In contrast, dynamic trigger-based attacks adaptively generate context-aware triggers to evade detection but suffer from poor cross-dataset transferability. Moreover, they rely on unrealistic assumptions of identical data distributions between poisoned and victim training data, limiting their practicality. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a novel attack that achieves both transferability and stealthiness without requiring complete victim data. STAB is motivated by the observation that adversarial perturbations in flat regions of the loss landscape transfer more effectively across datasets than those in sharp minima. To this end, we train a surrogate model using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to guide model parameters toward flat loss regions, and employ Gumbel-Softmax optimization to enable differentiable search over discrete trigger tokens for generating context-aware adversarial triggers. Experiments across three datasets and two code models show that STAB outperforms prior attacks in terms of transferability and stealthiness. It achieves a 73.2% average attack success rate after defense, outperforming static trigger-based attacks that fail under defense. STAB also surpasses the best dynamic trigger-based attack by 12.4% in cross-dataset attack success rate and maintains performance on clean inputs."}

Under review for KDD 2026", "summary": "We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

However, this fine-tuning process typically results in a slight performance decrease (pass@1 usually drops around 1\\% - 3\\%) compared to fine-tuning with unperturbed datasets, although occasional performance improvements are observed.\n  Conclusion \\& Implications: Fine-tuning LLMs for coding tasks with perturbed data effectively enhances their robustness at the cost of a minor performance reduction, emphasizing the importance of balancing the robustness and performance of LLMs for coding applications."}

While single-turn detection has been extensively studied, no published formula exists for aggregating per-turn pattern scores into a conversation-level risk score at the proxy layer -- without invoking an LLM. We identify a fundamental flaw in the intuitive weighted-average approach: it converges to the per-turn score regardless of turn count, meaning a 20-turn persistent attack scores identically to a single suspicious turn. Drawing on analogies from change-point detection (CUSUM), Bayesian belief updating, and security risk-based alerting, we propose peak + accumulation scoring -- a formula combining peak single-turn risk, persistence ratio, and category diversity. Evaluated on 10,654 multi-turn conversations -- 588 attacks sourced from WildJailbreak adversarial prompts and 10,066 benign conversations from WildChat -- the formula achieves 90.8% recall at 1.20% false positive rate with an F1 of 85.9%. A sensitivity analysis over the persistence parameter reveals a phase transition at rho ~ 0.4, where recall jumps 12 percentage points with negligible FPR increase.

Prior studies have documented debugging strategies and tool usage, but little theory explains how experienced developers reason about bugs in large, real-world codebases. We conducted a qualitative study using a grounded theory approach. We observed seven professional developers and five professional live-coding streamers working on 17 debugging tasks in their own codebases, capturing diverse contexts of debugging. We theorize debugging as a structured, iterative diagnostic process in which programmers update a mental model of the system to guide information gathering. Developers gather information by alternating between navigation and execution strategies, employing forward and backward tracing modes of reasoning and adapting these approaches according to codebase context, complexity, and familiarity. Developers also gather external resources to complement code-based evidence, with their experience enabling them to systematically construct a mental model.

While prior work has produced tool calling benchmarks and examined factuality in knowledge augmented systems, relatively little work studies their intersection: settings where LLMs must integrate large volumes of dynamic, structured and unstructured multi tool outputs. We investigate LLM failure modes in this regime using crypto as a representative high data density domain. We introduce (1) CryptoAnalystBench, an analyst aligned benchmark of 198 production crypto and DeFi queries spanning 11 categories; (2) an agentic harness equipped with relevant crypto and DeFi tools to generate responses across multiple frontier LLMs; and (3) an evaluation pipeline with citation verification and an LLM as a judge rubric spanning four user defined success dimensions: relevance, temporal relevance, depth, and data consistency. Using human annotation, we develop a taxonomy of seven higher order error types that are not reliably captured by factuality checks or LLM based quality scoring. We find that these failures persist even in state of the art systems and can compromise high stakes decisions. Based on this taxonomy, we refine the judge rubric to better capture these errors. While the judge does not align with human annotators on precise scoring across rubric iterations, it reliably identifies critical failure modes, enabling scalable feedback for developers and researchers studying analyst style agents. We release CryptoAnalystBench with annotated queries, the evaluation pipeline, judge rubrics, and the error taxonomy, and outline mitigation strategies and open challenges in evaluating long form, multi tool augmented systems."}

Current tools designed for managing contributor retention (e.g., dashboards) fall short by providing retrospective rather than predictive insights to identify potential disengagement early. Without understanding how to anticipate and prevent disengagement, new solutions risk burdening community managers rather than supporting retention management. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we employed a mixed-methods approach for problem identification and solution design to address contributor retention. To identify the challenges hindering retention management in OSS, we conducted semi-structured interviews, a multi-vocal literature review, and community surveys. Then through an iterative build-evaluate cycle, we developed and refined strategies for diagnosing retention risks and informing engagement efforts. We operationalized these strategies into a web-based prototype, incorporating feedback from 100+ OSS practitioners, and conducted an in situ evaluation across two OSS communities. Our study offers (1) empirical insights into the challenges of contributor retention management in OSS, (2) actionable strategies that support OSS community managers' retention efforts, and (3) a practical framework for future research in developing or validating theories about OSS sustainability."}

This paper presents a systematic security analysis of four emerging AI agent communication protocols. First, we develop a structured threat modeling analysis that examines protocol architectures, trust assumptions, interaction patterns, and lifecycle behaviors to identify protocol-specific and cross-protocol risk surfaces. Second, we introduce a qualitative risk assessment framework that identifies twelve protocol-level risks and evaluates security posture across the creation, operation, and update phases through systematic assessment of likelihood, impact, and overall protocol risk, with implications for secure deployment and future standardization. Third, we provide a measurement-driven case study on MCP that formalizes the risk of missing mandatory validation/attestation for executable components as a falsifiable security claim by quantifying wrong-provider tool execution under multi-server composition across representative resolver policies. Collectively, our results highlight key design-induced risk surfaces and provide actionable guidance for secure deployment and future standardization of agent communication ecosystems."}

SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions.

The trust decision space is formalized using a Heyting Algebra, allowing nuanced trust levels that extend beyond binary trusted/untrusted states.

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers."}

Such defenses can provably block unsafe actions by enforcing confidentiality and integrity policies, but currently appear costly: they reduce task completion rates and increase token usage compared to probabilistic defenses. We argue that existing evaluations miss a key benefit of system-level defenses: reduced reliance on human oversight. We introduce autonomy metrics to quantify this benefit: the fraction of consequential actions an agent can execute without human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval while preserving security. To increase autonomy, we design a security-aware agent that (i) introduces richer HITL interactions, and (ii) explicitly plans for both task progress and policy compliance. We implement this agent design atop an existing information-flow control defense against prompt injection and evaluate it on the AgentDojo and WASP benchmarks.

Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit."}

Intel provided guidance and support, including documentation and updated TDX 1.5 source code.

However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.\n  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall).

To reduce layout predictability, this research introduces ASLR-style diversity into OSv by randomizing the application base and thread stack regions through targeted changes to core memory-management and loading routines. The implementation adds minimal complexity while preserving OSv's lightweight design goals. Evaluation against an unmodified baseline finds comparable boot time, application runtime, and memory usage. Analysis indicates that the generated addresses exhibit a uniform distribution. These results show that layout-randomization defenses can be efficiently and effectively integrated into OSv unikernels, improving resistance to reliable exploitation."}

Decades of empirical software engineering research have accumulated a large but underused body of evidence on concrete practices that improve project health.\n  We close this gap by using LLMs as evidence miners over the SE literature. We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers. In the second layer, we apply follow-up prompting to filter hallucinations, extract impact and evidence, and assess soundness and precision.\n  Our pipeline yields 1,922 ReACTs, of which 1,312 pass strict quality criteria and are organized into practice-oriented categories connectable to project signals from tools like APEX. The result is a reproducible, scalable approach turning scattered research findings into structured, evidence-based actions guiding OSS projects toward sustainability."}

Under review", "summary": "Generative large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized multiple domains. Modern LLMs predominantly rely on an autoregressive decoding strategy, which generates output tokens sequentially and employs a key-value cache (KV cache) to avoid redundant computation. However, the widespread deployment of LLMs has raised serious privacy concerns, as users are feeding all types of data into the model, motivating the development of secure inference frameworks based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). A major limitation of existing FHE-based frameworks is their inability to effectively integrate the KV cache, resulting in prohibitively high latency for autoregressive decoding. In this paper, we propose Cachemir, a KV Cache Accelerated Homomorphic Encrypted LLM Inference Regime to overcome this limitation. Cachemir comprises three key technical contributions: 1) a set of novel HE packing algorithms specifically designed to leverage the computational advantages of the KV cache; 2) an interleaved replicated packing algorithm to efficiently compute the vector-matrix multiplications that result from using the KV cache in Transformer linear layers; and 3) an augmented bootstrapping placement strategy that accounts for the KV cache to minimize bootstrapping cost. We demonstrate that Cachemir achieves $48.83\\times$ and $67.16\\times$ speedup over MOAI (ICML'25) and THOR (CCS'25) respectively on CPU and consumes less than 100 seconds on GPU to generate an output token for Llama-3-8B."}

In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent."}

At the same time, emerging cyber physical threats such as backdoor triggers, sensor spoofing, label flipping attacks, and poisoned model updates further jeopardize operational safety as mines adopt autonomous vehicles, humanoid assistance, and federated learning for collaborative intelligence. Energy constrained sensors also experience uneven battery depletion, creating blind spots in safety coverage and disrupting hazard detection pipelines.

By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler.

Adversarial users exploit these models through carefully crafted prompts to elicit restricted or unsafe outputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Jailbreaking. Despite numerous proposed defense mechanisms, attackers continue to develop adaptive prompting strategies, and existing models remain vulnerable. This motivates approaches that examine the internal behavior of LLMs rather than relying solely on prompt-level defenses. In this work, we study jailbreaking from both security and interpretability perspectives by analyzing how internal representations differ between jailbreak and benign prompts. We conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis across multiple open-source models, including GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral, and the state-space model Mamba, and identify consistent latent-space patterns associated with harmful inputs. We then propose a tensor-based latent representation framework that captures structure in hidden activations and enables lightweight jailbreak detection without model fine-tuning or auxiliary LLM-based detectors. We further demonstrate that the latent signals can be used to actively disrupt jailbreak execution at inference time. On an abliterated LLaMA-3.1-8B model, selectively bypassing high-susceptibility layers blocks 78% of jailbreak attempts while preserving benign behavior on 94% of benign prompts. This intervention operates entirely at inference time and introduces minimal overhead, providing a scalable foundation for achieving stronger coverage by incorporating additional attack distributions or more refined susceptibility thresholds. Our results provide evidence that jailbreak behavior is rooted in identifiable internal structures and suggest a complementary, architecture-agnostic direction for improving LLM security."}

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\\textbf{m}ated opt\\textbf{i}mization modeli\\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \\textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \\textbf{F}ine-Tuning \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement.

This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\\geq80\\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated.

This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information.

The enormous computational demands, however, hinder the local deployment on devices with limited resources. The current prevalent LLM inference paradigms require users to send queries to the service providers for processing, which raises critical privacy concerns. Existing approaches propose to allow the users to obfuscate the token embeddings before transmission and utilize local models for denoising. Nonetheless, transmitting the token embeddings and deploying local models may result in excessive communication and computation overhead, preventing practical implementation.

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms."}

We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons.

While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost."}

Moreover, they are inherently limited as altering user text to hide sensitive cues still allows attribute inference to occur through models' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a unified defense framework that combines fine-grained anonymization (TRACE) with inference-preventing optimization (RPS). TRACE leverages attention mechanisms and inference chain generation to identify and anonymize privacy-leaking textual elements, while RPS employs a lightweight two-stage optimization strategy to induce model rejection behaviors, thereby preventing attribute inference. Evaluations across diverse LLMs show that TRACE-RPS reduces attribute inference accuracy from around 50\\% to below 5\\% on open-source models.

This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%.

In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique."}

Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines.

In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.\n  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%.

Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance."}

One Figure", "summary": "Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.\n  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation."}

Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions."}

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recognizing complex patterns, yet their deployment on edge devices remains impractical due to their resource demands. However, in edge malware detection, static or centrally retrained models degrade under evolving threats and heterogeneous traffic; locally trained models become siloed and fail to transfer across domains. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a continuous learning architecture for edge-based malware detection that combines local adaptation on each device with global knowledge sharing through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Lightweight transformer models (DistilBERT, DistilGPT-2, TinyT5) run on edge nodes and are incrementally fine-tuned on device-specific traffic; only the resulting LoRA modules are aggregated by a lightweight coordinator and redistributed, enabling cross-device generalization without exchanging raw data. We evaluate on two public IoT security datasets, Edge-IIoTset and TON-IoT, under multi-round learning to simulate evolving threats. Compared to isolated fine-tuning, the LoRA-based exchange yields up to 20-25% accuracy gains when models encounter previously unseen attacks from another domain, while maintaining stable loss and F1 across rounds. LoRA adds less than 1% to model size (~0.6-1.8 MB), making updates practical for constrained edge hardware."}

However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets, covering domains such as traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput, demonstrate that Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy."}

This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models.

Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable.

This work proposes an enhanced anonymity architecture, evolving the Loopix mix-network, to provide robust security and reliability in these volatile topologies. We introduce three primary contributions: (1) A multi-path transport protocol utilizing $(n, k)$ erasure codes, which is demonstrated to counteract the high link volatility and intermittent connectivity that renders standard mix-networks unreliable. (2) The integration of a computationally efficient Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol during route discovery. (3) The introduction of adaptive, centrality-based delay strategies that efficiently mitigate the inherent topological bias of LEO networks, providing a superior anonymity-to-latency trade-off. This mechanism provably prevents metadata leakage at the user-provider directory, mitigating profiling and correlation attacks. We validate this architecture via high-fidelity, packet-level simulations of a LEO constellation. Empirical results show our multi-path transport achieves near-zero message loss, establishing a quantifiable trade-off between reliability and bandwidth overhead. Furthermore, microbenchmarks of the PIR protocol quantify its computational and latency overheads, confirming its feasibility for practical deployment.

Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency."}

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

This paper empirically investigates whether widely studied performance antipatterns defined by Smith and Williams also negatively influence power usage. We implement ten antipatterns as isolated microservices and evaluate them under controlled load conditions, collecting synchronized measurements of performance, CPU and DRAM power consumption, and resource utilization across 30 repeated runs per antipattern. The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption. The study provides a systematic foundation for identifying performance antipatterns that also behave as energy antipatterns and offers actionable insights for designing more energy-efficient microservices architectures."}

While recent advancements have utilized watermark ensembles to enhance robustness, prevailing methods typically prioritize maximizing the strength of the watermark at every individual layer. In this work, we identify a critical limitation in this \"stronger-is-better\" approach: strong watermarks significantly reduce the entropy of the token distribution, which paradoxically weakens the effectiveness of watermarking in subsequent layers. We theoretically and empirically show that detectability is bounded by entropy and that watermark ensembles induce a monotonic decrease in both entropy and the expected green-list ratio across layers. To address this inherent trade-off, we propose a general framework that utilizes weaker single-layer watermarks to preserve the entropy required for effective multi-layer ensembling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this counter-intuitive strategy mitigates signal decay and consistently outperforms strong baselines in both detectability and robustness."}

Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales.

While Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is the primary scalable defence, its computationally intensive handshakes create a significant bottleneck for the RAN control plane, posing sustainability challenges. This paper proposes an energy-aware framework to solve this PQC bottleneck, ensuring quantum resilience without sacrificing operational energy efficiency. The system employs an O-RAN aligned split: a Crypto Policy rApp residing in the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT) RIC defines the strategic security envelope (including PQC suites), while a Security Operations Scheduling (SOS) xApp in the Near-RT RIC converts these into tactical timing and placement intents. Cryptographic enforcement remains at standards-compliant endpoints: the Open Fronthaul utilizes Media Access Control Security (MACsec) at the O-DU/O-RU, while the xhaul (midhaul and backhaul) utilizes IP Security (IPsec) at tunnel terminators. The SOS xApp reduces PQC overhead by batching non-urgent handshakes, prioritizing session resumption, and selecting parameters that meet slice SLAs while minimizing joules per secure connection. We evaluate the architecture via a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) using 3GPP-aligned traffic profiles and verified hardware benchmarks from literature. Results show that intelligent scheduling can reduce per-handshake energy by approximately 60 percent without violating slice latency targets."}

Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property."}

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

While effective for bounded classification tasks, these architectures struggle to support accountable decision-making under adversarial uncertainty, where actions must be justified, governed, and aligned with organizational and regulatory constraints. This paper argues that cybersecurity orchestration should be reconceptualized as an agentic, multi-agent cognitive system, rather than a linear sequence of detection and response components. We introduce a conceptual architectural framework in which heterogeneous AI agents responsible for detection, hypothesis formation, contextual interpretation, explanation, and governance are coordinated through an explicit meta-cognitive judgement function. This function governs decision readiness and dynamically calibrates system autonomy when evidence is incomplete, conflicting, or operationally risky. By synthesizing distributed cognition theory, multi-agent systems research, and responsible AI governance frameworks, we demonstrate that modern security operations already function as distributed cognitive systems, albeit without an explicit organizing principle. Our contribution is to make this cognitive structure architecturally explicit and governable by embedding meta-cognitive judgement as a first-class system function. We discuss implications for security operations centers, accountable autonomy, and the design of next-generation AI-enabled cyber defence architectures. The proposed framework shifts the focus of AI in cybersecurity from optimizing isolated predictions to governing autonomy under uncertainty."}

This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets.

By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance.

Existing backdoor attacks on code models face a fundamental trade-off between transferability and stealthiness. Static trigger-based attacks insert fixed dead code patterns that transfer well across models and datasets but are easily detected by code-specific defenses. In contrast, dynamic trigger-based attacks adaptively generate context-aware triggers to evade detection but suffer from poor cross-dataset transferability. Moreover, they rely on unrealistic assumptions of identical data distributions between poisoned and victim training data, limiting their practicality. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a novel attack that achieves both transferability and stealthiness without requiring complete victim data. STAB is motivated by the observation that adversarial perturbations in flat regions of the loss landscape transfer more effectively across datasets than those in sharp minima. To this end, we train a surrogate model using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to guide model parameters toward flat loss regions, and employ Gumbel-Softmax optimization to enable differentiable search over discrete trigger tokens for generating context-aware adversarial triggers. Experiments across three datasets and two code models show that STAB outperforms prior attacks in terms of transferability and stealthiness. It achieves a 73.2% average attack success rate after defense, outperforming static trigger-based attacks that fail under defense. STAB also surpasses the best dynamic trigger-based attack by 12.4% in cross-dataset attack success rate and maintains performance on clean inputs."}

We leverage non-interactive ZKP schemes to generate proofs that attest to the correct implementation of PAC privacy mechanisms while maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary systems.

Here we propose the \\textbf{Adaptive Physics Transformer} (APT), a geometry-, mesh-, and physics-agnostic neural operator that explicitly addresses these challenges. APT fuses a graph-based encoder to extract high-resolution local heterogeneous features with a global attention mechanism to resolve long-range physical impacts. Our results demonstrate that APT outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in subsurface tasks across both regular and irregular grids with robust super-resolution capabilities. Notably, APT is the first architecture that directly learns from adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We also demonstrate APT's capability for cross-dataset learning, positioning it as a robust and scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface foundation model development."}

Its ultra-reliable low-latency configuration targets round-trip times below 1 ms, while optional security controls extend protection across all interfaces, making 5G attractive for mission-critical applications. A key enabler of low latency is the disaggregation of network components, including the RAN, allowing user-plane functions to be deployed nearer to end users. However, this split introduces additional interfaces, whose protection increases latency overhead. In this paper, guided by discussions with a network operator and a 5G manufacturer, we evaluate the latency overhead of enabling optional 5G security controls across internal RAN interfaces and the 5G user plane. To this end, we deploy the first testbed implementing a disaggregated RAN with standardized optional security mechanisms. Our results show that disaggregated RAN deployments retain a latency advantage over monolithic designs, even with security enabled. However, achieving sub-1 ms round-trip times remains challenging, as cryptographic overhead alone can already exceed this target."}

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring."}

In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development."}

When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication."}

Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity."}

In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%."}

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction.

Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness."}

This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints."}

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks."}

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias."}

This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration."}

This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance).

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions."}

In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems."}

Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings."}

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains."}

We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\\times$ reduction in state dimension.

To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering.

It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%.

Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries.

When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails."}

To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive \"feature sharpness\" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures.

Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

We present a general recipe for efficiently steering unconditional diffusion {without gradient guidance during inference}, enabling fast controllable generation. Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance, while achieving significant inference speedups."}

In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability."}

If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\\%$ on average.

Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model.

We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale.

This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains.

Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence."}

AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety."}

Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts."}

In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models."}

MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores.

Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic.

Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features.

First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem.

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing.

We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances.

As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \\modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \\modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity."}

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric."}

We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently. Finally, we extend our methods to the more general k-median consensus clustering problem."}

Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel."}

This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors."}

We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference."}

By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates.

Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld.

To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation.

To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting.

Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length.

One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

In this work, we introduce two proactive anomaly detection frameworks: the Forward Forecasting Model (FFM) and the Backward Reconstruction Model (BRM). Both models leverage a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformer encoders to model directional temporal dynamics. FFM forecasts future sequences to anticipate disruptions, while BRM reconstructs recent history from future context to uncover early precursors. Anomalies are flagged based on forecasting error magnitudes and directional embedding discrepancies. Our models support both continuous and discrete multivariate features, enabling robust performance in real-world settings. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MSL, SMAP, SMD, and PSM, demonstrate that FFM and BRM outperform state-of-the-art baselines across detection metrics and significantly improve the timeliness of anomaly anticipation.

To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency.

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems."}

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages.

Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1.

In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms."}

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process.

In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation.

We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution.

Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace."}

By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks)."}

We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering."}

We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection.

In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics."}

However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value.

ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features.

Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP ."}

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods."}

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors."}

Despite its popularity, and despite being presented through the lens of algebraic topology, the exact relationship between UMAP and classical spectral methods has remained informal. In this work, we prove that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k nearest neighbour graph. Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels, and holds as a first order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy type kernel. Our result unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under a single framework, and provides theoretical grounding for several empirical observations about UMAP's behaviour."}

We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.\n  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS.

By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution.

We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales.

For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns.

For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary.

Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%.

We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences."}

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively."}

However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule."}

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs."}

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\\textbf{m}ated opt\\textbf{i}mization modeli\\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training.

We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms."}

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances"}

This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%.

Submitted to TMLR", "summary": "Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment."}

Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance."}

Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training.

However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets, covering domains such as traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput, demonstrate that Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy."}

While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property."}

This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases.

This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets.

We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets. The results demonstrate that ISC method provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks."}

Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\\% of the container baseline. Empirical results demonstrate that SWE-MiniSandbox achieves evaluation performance comparable to standard container-based pipelines. By removing the dependency on heavy container infrastructure, SWE-MiniSandbox offers a practical and accessible foundation for scaling RL-based SWE agents, particularly in resource-constrained research environments."}

We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition.

However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases."}

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias."}

When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations.

We investigate LLM failure modes in this regime using crypto as a representative high data density domain. We introduce (1) CryptoAnalystBench, an analyst aligned benchmark of 198 production crypto and DeFi queries spanning 11 categories; (2) an agentic harness equipped with relevant crypto and DeFi tools to generate responses across multiple frontier LLMs; and (3) an evaluation pipeline with citation verification and an LLM as a judge rubric spanning four user defined success dimensions: relevance, temporal relevance, depth, and data consistency. Using human annotation, we develop a taxonomy of seven higher order error types that are not reliably captured by factuality checks or LLM based quality scoring. We find that these failures persist even in state of the art systems and can compromise high stakes decisions. Based on this taxonomy, we refine the judge rubric to better capture these errors. While the judge does not align with human annotators on precise scoring across rubric iterations, it reliably identifies critical failure modes, enabling scalable feedback for developers and researchers studying analyst style agents. We release CryptoAnalystBench with annotated queries, the evaluation pipeline, judge rubrics, and the error taxonomy, and outline mitigation strategies and open challenges in evaluating long form, multi tool augmented systems."}

Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data.

We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789).

Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS.

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region.

For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\\max\\{0,Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it."}

Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings."}

The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph."}

We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide."}

Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality."}

We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\\times$ reduction in state dimension. By reducing both the attention cache and the SSM state, the resulting hybrid is $5$--$6\\times$ more memory-efficient than comparable hybrids, closing the Transformer--SSM gap at a fraction of the memory cost."}

However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models."}

Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method.

Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions.

Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice.

Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.\n  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds.

An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications."}

Proactive Defense Against Attribute Inference Attack in LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can infer private user attributes (e.g., age, location, gender) from user-generated text shared online, enabling rapid and large-scale privacy breaches. Existing anonymization-based defenses are coarse-grained, lacking word-level precision in anonymizing privacy-leaking elements. Moreover, they are inherently limited as altering user text to hide sensitive cues still allows attribute inference to occur through models' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a unified defense framework that combines fine-grained anonymization (TRACE) with inference-preventing optimization (RPS). TRACE leverages attention mechanisms and inference chain generation to identify and anonymize privacy-leaking textual elements, while RPS employs a lightweight two-stage optimization strategy to induce model rejection behaviors, thereby preventing attribute inference. Evaluations across diverse LLMs show that TRACE-RPS reduces attribute inference accuracy from around 50\\% to below 5\\% on open-source models. In addition, our approach offers strong cross-model generalization, prompt-variation robustness, and utility-privacy tradeoffs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-Yan/TRACE-RPS."}

Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines."}

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting."}

Dense and nonlinear architectures (e.g., LSTMs) on the other hand are provably more expressive, but computationally costly. Here, we explore how expressivity in LRNNs can be increased via richer state mixing across time and channels while maintaining competitive efficiency. Specifically, we introduce two structured LRNN architectures: (i) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU), which generalize first-order recurrence to higher order, mixing multiple past states, and (ii) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU), which enable dense intra-block channel mixing. Per-channel (H-LRU) or per-row (BD-LRU) L1-normalization of selective gates stabilizes training and allows for scaling window/block sizes. A parallel-scan implementation of the proposed architectures keeps the throughput competitive with diagonal LRNNs for moderate orders (H-LRU) and block sizes (BD-LRU). In synthetic sequence modeling tasks, the performance of BD-LRU matches or exceeds those of linear SSMs (Mamba), low-rank LRNNs (DeltaNet) and LSTM baselines, while H-LRU is found to be the most parameter-efficient in compression task. In both synthetic sequence modeling and language modeling, our results indicate that the structure of state mixing rather than width alone shapes expressivity of LRNNs, offering a practical route to closing the efficiency-expressivity gap in linear sequence models."}

Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention."}

We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases.

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems."}

This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads."}

We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures.

Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species.

The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation.

ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features.

Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recognizing complex patterns, yet their deployment on edge devices remains impractical due to their resource demands. However, in edge malware detection, static or centrally retrained models degrade under evolving threats and heterogeneous traffic; locally trained models become siloed and fail to transfer across domains. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a continuous learning architecture for edge-based malware detection that combines local adaptation on each device with global knowledge sharing through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Lightweight transformer models (DistilBERT, DistilGPT-2, TinyT5) run on edge nodes and are incrementally fine-tuned on device-specific traffic; only the resulting LoRA modules are aggregated by a lightweight coordinator and redistributed, enabling cross-device generalization without exchanging raw data. We evaluate on two public IoT security datasets, Edge-IIoTset and TON-IoT, under multi-round learning to simulate evolving threats. Compared to isolated fine-tuning, the LoRA-based exchange yields up to 20-25% accuracy gains when models encounter previously unseen attacks from another domain, while maintaining stable loss and F1 across rounds.

The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods.

A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect."}

Bayesian Optimization has emerged as a sample-efficient framework for this problem. However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization."}

Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline.

Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment.

At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls.

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances"}

We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse \"vulnerability games\", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow \"tricks\" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even \"distilled\" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

Submitted to TMLR", "summary": "Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment."}

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD."}

In this study, we propose a novel CIDS framework designed for easy deployment across diverse distributed environments. The framework dynamically optimizes detector allocation per node based on available resources and data types, enabling rapid adaptation to new operational scenarios with minimal computational overhead. We first conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify key characteristics of existing CIDS architectures.

However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster."}

We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime.

While effective for bounded classification tasks, these architectures struggle to support accountable decision-making under adversarial uncertainty, where actions must be justified, governed, and aligned with organizational and regulatory constraints. This paper argues that cybersecurity orchestration should be reconceptualized as an agentic, multi-agent cognitive system, rather than a linear sequence of detection and response components. We introduce a conceptual architectural framework in which heterogeneous AI agents responsible for detection, hypothesis formation, contextual interpretation, explanation, and governance are coordinated through an explicit meta-cognitive judgement function. This function governs decision readiness and dynamically calibrates system autonomy when evidence is incomplete, conflicting, or operationally risky. By synthesizing distributed cognition theory, multi-agent systems research, and responsible AI governance frameworks, we demonstrate that modern security operations already function as distributed cognitive systems, albeit without an explicit organizing principle. Our contribution is to make this cognitive structure architecturally explicit and governable by embedding meta-cognitive judgement as a first-class system function. We discuss implications for security operations centers, accountable autonomy, and the design of next-generation AI-enabled cyber defence architectures.

In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment."}

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\\max\\{0,Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it."}

Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain."}

Despite their effectiveness, the effects of sampling and reference choices are poorly understood theoretically. We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods. Experiments on real-world preference data validate our findings."}

However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.\n  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios."}

While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs."}

In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.\n  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements."}

We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions."}

We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update.

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/G-OPD", "summary": "On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD."}

However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series."}

Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth.

Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead.

As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\\% of the container baseline.

First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks."}

Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families.

In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters."}

Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide."}

This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers.

Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities."}

Equal contribution: Yordan Yordanov and Matteo Forasassi. 39 pages, 25 figures, 22 tables", "summary": "While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines."}
