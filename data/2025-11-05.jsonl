We\nsystematically evaluate embedding-based retrieval, prompt-based listwise\nranking, and hybrid approaches, revealing that method effectiveness depends\nheavily on domain-specific factors rather than inherent algorithmic\nsuperiority. Through empirical investigation on enterprise-derived benchmarks,\nwe find that embedding-based methods offer superior latency for large tool\nrepositories, while listwise ranking provides better disambiguation for\noverlapping functionalities, with hybrid approaches showing promise in specific\ncontexts.

However, their\napplication to large-scale engineering tasks suffers from significant\ncomputational overhead. And the fact that current models impose a uniform\ncomputational cost while physical fields exhibit vastly different complexities\nconstitutes a fundamental mismatch, which is the root of this inefficiency. For\ninstance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network\nprocessing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework:\nSkip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based\nneural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer\narchitectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and\nranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference. Then, in later\nlayers, it decides how many tokens are passed forward based on this ranking.\nThis way, the model focuses more processing capacity on the tokens that are\nmore complex. Experiments demonstrate that SBR is a general framework that\nseamlessly integrates into various neural operators. Our method reduces\ncomputational cost by approximately 50% in terms of Floating Point Operations\n(FLOPs), while still delivering up to 2x faster inference without sacrificing\naccuracy."}

Program comprehension is key\nto all these activities, as it demands developers to grasp the knowledge (e.g.,\nimplementation details) required to modify the codebase. Methods as main\nbuilding blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for\ncode comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be\nchallenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We\npropose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists\ndevelopers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin\nacts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is\naugmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the\nend-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the\ncomment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a\ncall graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search\n(DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompts. Result: The product is a software, as a plugin, developed for\nJava codebase and installable on IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin can serve\nconcurrently for methods whose comments are being updated , and it shares\nmemory across all flows to avoid redundant calls. o measure the accuracy of\nthis solution, a dedicated test case is run to record SmartDoc generated\ncomments and their corresponding ground truth. For each collected result-set,\nthree metrics are computed, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE-1. These metrics will\ndetermine how accurate the generated comments are in comparison to the ground\ntruth.

Prompt writing is\nthe process of writing instructions for generative AI tools like ChatGPT to\nelicit desired outputs and there has been an upsurge of conversations about it\non social media. To study this rhetorical activity, we build on four\noverlapping traditions of digital writing research in computers and composition\nthat inform how we frame literacies, how we study social media rhetorics, how\nwe engage iteratively and reflexively with methodologies and technologies, and\nhow we blend computational methods with qualitative methods.

However, this\nreliance on structural information raises privacy concerns and often leads to\npoor generalization across different networks. In this work, we address a key\nquestion: Can we design a node importance ranking model trained exclusively on\nsynthetic networks that is effectively appliable to real-world networks,\neliminating the need to rely on the topology of target networks and improving\nboth practicality and generalizability? We answer this question affirmatively\nby proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel\nframework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust,\ninvariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN\nintroduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an\nautoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related\nto node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a\nunified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and\nranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation\nlearning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on\nsynthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking\naccuracy and generalization capability."}

However, the applicability\nin industrial contexts needs additional empirical evidence.\n  To mitigate this need, this paper assesses the applicability of FGA on a\nbenchmark made by the MNIST and LSC datasets. We assessed the effectiveness of\nFGA in computing rules that explain the behavior of the neural network. Our\nresults show that FGA has a higher precision on our benchmark than the results\nfrom the literature. We also evaluated how the selection of the neural network\narchitecture, training, and feature selection affect the effectiveness of FGA.\nOur results show that the selection significantly affects the recall of FGA,\nwhile it has a negligible impact on its precision."}

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in\ncases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.\nDepression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it\ndifficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and\nunwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use\nonline social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,\nsocial media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be\nutilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing\napproaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of\nsocial media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that\ncombines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among\nsocial media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,\nwe propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets\nand (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also\nextract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a\nuser. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural\nNetwork (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to\ncreate the visual feature vector for prediction. We contribute a curated\nCovid-19 dataset of depressed and non-depressed users for research purposes and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model in detecting depression during the\nCovid-19 outbreak. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods over\na benchmark dataset by 2%-8% and produces promising results on the Covid-19\ndataset. Our analysis highlights the impact of each modality and provides\nvaluable insights into users' mental and emotional states."}

DRIP introduces two lightweight yet\ncomplementary mechanisms: (1) a token-wise de-instruction shift that performs\nsemantic disentanglement, weakening directive semantics in data tokens while\npreserving content meaning; and (2) a residual fusion pathway that provides a\npersistent semantic anchor, reinforcing the influence of the true top-level\ninstruction during generation.

DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall\nperformance (total score: 86.03 $\\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes\ndomains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that\nreasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard\ncounterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed\nrelative to its standard version (80.79 $\\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\\pm$ 1.92),\nindicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for\nclinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific\nvulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified\ncomplexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality\n(+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning\ndivergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings\nadvocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain\nvisualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation\nframework for surgical LLM deployment."}

Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x)."}

And if so, can we measure it? We\nintroduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for\nmeasuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the \"Guess\n2/3 of Average\" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across\n4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against\nother AI models, and (C) against AI models like you.

The\nmajority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness,\nwhile older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware\nmodels rank themselves as most rational.

Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine\nlearning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting\ntheir scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge\nElicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer\nstaging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses\nan iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from\nunannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The\nsecond, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG),\nemploys a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant\nguidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and\navoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply\nbroad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer\npathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in\nidentifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches\non two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG\nwhen Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG\nachieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both\nmethods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules\nexplicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation\nmethods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging\nwith enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited\nannotated data."}

Secondly, the process is repeated for a different\ngroup of measurements. Finally, the convergence scores are compared to identify\nwhich one belongs to a different damage state. The process for both\nhealthy-to-healthy and damage-to-healthy input data creates, simultaneously,\nmeasurements for digital twinning purposes at different damage states, capable\nof pattern recognition and machine learning data generation. Further to this\nprocess, a support vector machine classifier and a principal component analysis\nprocedure is developed to assess the generated and real measurements of each\ndamage category, serving as a secondary new dynamics learning indicator in\ndamage scenarios. Importantly, the approach is shown to capture accurately\ndamage over healthy measurements, providing a powerful tool for vibration-based\nsystem-level monitoring and scalable infrastructure resilience."}

When the underlying graph structure varies, even the state-of-the-art\nRL methods require recomputation or at least fine-tuning, which can be\ntime-consuming and impair real-time applicability. This paper proposes an\nEquilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) framework to effectively learn a\ngeneralized policy with robust cross-graph zero-shot performance. In the\ncontext of PEGs, our framework is generally applicable to both pursuer and\nevader sides in both no-exit and multi-exit scenarios. These two\ngeneralizability properties, to our knowledge, are the first to appear in this\ndomain. The core idea of the EPG framework is to train an RL policy across\ndifferent graph structures against the equilibrium policy for each single\ngraph. To construct an equilibrium oracle for single-graph policies, we present\na dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that provably generates pure-strategy Nash\nequilibrium with near-optimal time complexity. To guarantee scalability with\nrespect to pursuer number, we further extend DP and RL by designing a grouping\nmechanism and a sequence model for joint policy decomposition, respectively.\nExperimental results show that, using equilibrium guidance and a distance\nfeature proposed for cross-graph PEG training, the EPG framework guarantees\ndesirable zero-shot performance in various unseen real-world graphs. Besides,\nwhen trained under an equilibrium heuristic proposed for the graphs with exits,\nour generalized pursuer policy can even match the performance of the fine-tuned\npolicies from the state-of-the-art PEG methods."}

Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO\ndemonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with\nmulti-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the\nframework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces\nqueue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic\ncontrol compatible with probe vehicle technology.

We investigate this trade-off between data fidelity and cost in\nneural surrogates using low- and high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS) simulations. Reformulating classical scaling laws, we decompose the\ndataset axis into compute budget and dataset composition. Our experiments\nreveal compute-performance scaling behavior and exhibit budget-dependent\noptimal fidelity mixes for the given dataset configuration. These findings\nprovide the first study of empirical scaling laws for multi-fidelity neural\nsurrogate datasets and offer practical considerations for compute-efficient\ndataset generation in scientific machine learning."}

While multi-task learning\ncan mitigate forgetting, it requires simultaneous access to all datasets and\nimposes computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of tasks.\nIn this work, we introduce a routing-based approach that enables the\nintegration of new tasks while preserving the foundational knowledge acquired\nduring pretraining. We evaluate our method using InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B\nparameters) and demonstrate that routing preserves the model's foundational\ncapabilities by maintaining performance on general-purpose benchmarks such as\nChartQA, MMBench, and DocVQA, while simultaneously improving accuracy on\nspecialized tasks. Importantly, our approach achieves this without requiring\nconcurrent access to data from all tasks, avoiding the significant\ncomputational and data overhead associated with traditional multi-task\nlearning. We further conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the\nscalability and robustness of routing-based learning, showing that the approach\nis resilient to a growing number of tasks and performs particularly well when\nnew tasks are semantically related.

Taking inspiration from computational neuroscience, we\nintroduce a new interpretability objective -- Temporal Feature Analysis --\nwhich possesses a temporal inductive bias to decompose representations at a\ngiven time into two parts: a predictable component, which can be inferred from\nthe context, and a residual component, which captures novel information\nunexplained by the context.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical\nguideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base\nmodel, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both\nsafety and fairness."}

In this field, existing research predominantly adopts\nmulti-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks\npresents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC)\nproblem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on\ncentralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic\nconditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all\nintersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model\ncompatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design\ninclude state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning\nand manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on\nqueue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length\ndefinition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions\nbut is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows\nfor reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With\nprobe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the\nproposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was\ncomprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale\nregional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control."}

Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning\nlength and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short\nreasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones\naccumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be\nfound ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the\ntree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length,\nrendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a\nmodel-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by\nselectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to\nselect the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the\noptimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring\nadditional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025\ndatasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves\naccuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases\nrepetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and\nefficient LRM reasoning."}

Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method\nmoves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying\nlearning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.\nOverall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and\nbehaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation\nthat can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis."}
