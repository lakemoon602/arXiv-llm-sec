Bounds on Degree-Eigenvector Misalignment in Assortative Structured Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "A tight alignment between the degree vector and the leading eigenvector arises naturally in networks with neutral degree mixing and the absence of local structures. Many real-world networks, however, violate both conditions. We derive bounds on the divergence between the degree vector and the eigenvector in networks with degree assortativity and local mesoscopic structures such as communities, core-peripheries, and cycles. Our approach is constructive. We design sufficiently general degree-preserving rewiring algorithms that start from a neutral benchmark and monotonically increase assortativity and the strength of local structures, with each step inducing a perturbation of the adjacency matrix. Using the Stewart--Sun Perturbation Bound, together with explicit spectral-norm control of the rewiring steps, we derive upper bounds on the angle between the eigenvector and the degree vector for modest levels of assortativity and local structures. Our analytical bounds delineate regions of `spectral safety' in which a node's degree can be used as a reliable measure of its systemic importance in real-world networks."}

This study presents a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-informed heuristics to systematically analyze and quantify affective polarization in discussions on divisive topics such as climate change and gun control. Unlike most prior approaches that relied on sentiment analysis or predefined classifiers, our method integrates LLMs to extract stance, affective tone, and agreement patterns from large-scale social media discussions. We then apply a rule-based scoring system capable of quantifying affective polarization even in small conversations consisting of single interactions, based on stance alignment, emotional content, and interaction dynamics. Our analysis reveals distinct polarization patterns that are event dependent: (i) anticipation-driven polarization, where extreme polarization escalates before well-publicized events, and (ii) reactive polarization, where intense affective polarization spikes immediately after sudden, high-impact events. By combining AI-driven content annotation with domain-informed scoring, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to measuring affective polarization.

Focusing on the MyBoyfriendIsAI (MBIA) subreddit, we reconstruct the Reddit activity histories of more than 3,000 highly engaged users over two years, yielding over 67,000 historical submissions. We then situate MBIA within a broader ecosystem by building a historical interaction network spanning more than 2,000 subreddits, which enables us to trace cross-community pathways and measure how toxicity and emotional expression vary across these trajectories. We find that MBIA users primarily traverse four surrounding community spheres (AI-companionship, porn-related, forum-like, and gaming) and that participation across the ecosystem exhibits a distinct gendered structure, with substantial engagement by female users. While toxicity is generally low across most pathways, we observe localized spikes concentrated in a small subset of AI-porn and gender-oriented communities. Nearly 16% of users engage with gender-focused subreddits, and their trajectories display systematically different patterns of emotional expression and elevated toxicity, suggesting that a minority of gendered pathways may act as toxicity amplifiers within the broader AI-companionship ecosystem. These results characterize the gendered structure of cross-community participation around AI companionship on Reddit and highlight where risks concentrate, informing measurement, moderation, and design practices for human-AI relationship platforms."}

Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup."}

We then quantify race (African American vs. European American) and gender (women vs. men) associations with valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) across 17 occupations and 7 awards.

Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020)."}

Given this situation, this study aims to strengthen the security of the university's wireless network through the application of data analytics, employing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive approaches to the logs generated by the wireless controller (WLC). The methodology consisted of collecting and processing connection data from users, devices, and daily traffic, analyzing behavioral patterns, and detecting anomalies based on statistical models and machine learning algorithms. The results revealed critical usage peaks between 10:00 and 14:00, as well as anomalous behavior associated with recurring devices and irregular traffic spikes.

However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks."}

In India, the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act mandates rigorous data privacy and compliance requirements, necessitating software frameworks that are both ethical and regulation-aware. From a software development perspective, traditional compliance tools often rely on hard-coded rules and static configurations, making them inflexible to dynamic policy updates or evolving legal contexts. Additionally, their monolithic architectures obscure decision-making processes, creating black-box behavior in critical governance workflows. Developing responsible AI software demands transparency, traceability, and adaptive enforcement mechanisms that make ethical decisions explainable. To address this challenge, a novel agentic framework is introduced to embed compliance logic directly into software agents that govern and adapt data policies. In this paper, the implementation focuses on the DPDP Act. The framework integrates KYU Agent and Compliance Agent for this purpose. KYU (Know-YourUser) Agent supports semantic understanding, user trustworthiness modelling and Compliance Agent uses data sensitivity reasoning within a goal-driven, agentic pipeline. The proposed framework, built using an open-sourced agentic framework and has been evaluated across ten diverse domains, including healthcare, education, and e-commerce. Its effectiveness under DPDP, measured via an Anonymization Score, demonstrates scalable, compliant data governance through masking, pseudonymization, and generalization strategies tailored to domain-specific needs. The proposed framework delivers scalable, transparent, and compliant data governance through collaborative agents, dynamic policy enforcement, and domain-aware anonymization."}

The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles.

Each experiment is executed in a controlled Colab environment instrumented with the CodeCarbon toolkit to quantify power draw and equivalent CO2 output during both training and inference. We construct an Eco Efficiency Index that expresses F1 score per kilowatt hour to capture the trade off between detection quality and environmental impact. Results reveal that optimized Random Forest and lightweight Logistic Regression models achieve the highest eco efficiency, reducing energy consumption by more than forty percent compared to XGBoost while sustaining competitive detection accuracy. Principal Component Analysis further decreases computational load with negligible loss in recall. Collectively, these findings establish that integrating carbon and energy metrics into cybersecurity workflows enables environmentally responsible machine learning without compromising operational protection. The proposed framework offers a reproducible path toward sustainable carbon accountable cybersecurity aligned with emerging US green computing and federal energy efficiency initiatives."}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on topology alone, which often provides insufficient and noisy cues. This paper leverages network steady-state dynamics -- converged node states under a given dynamical process -- as an additional and widely accessible observation for network evolution history inference. We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$ρ$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth. Moreover, a steady-state-only variant remains competitive when reliable topology is limited, highlighting steady states as an independent signal for evolution inference."}

However, existing research in legal judgment generation has predominantly focused on first-instance trials, relying on static fact-to-verdict mappings while neglecting the dialectical nature of appellate (second-instance) review. To address this, we introduce AppellateGen, a benchmark for second-instance legal judgment generation comprising 7,351 case pairs. The task requires models to draft legally binding judgments by reasoning over the initial verdict and evidentiary updates, thereby modeling the causal dependency between trial stages. We further propose a judicial Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)-based Legal Multi-Agent System (SLMAS) to simulate judicial workflows, which decomposes the generation process into discrete stages of issue identification, retrieval, and drafting. Experimental results indicate that while SLMAS improves logical consistency, the complexity of appellate reasoning remains a substantial challenge for current LLMs. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AppellateGen-5763."}

We present a framework to measure execution-time memory stability across multiple correct generations. At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability. Our results support stability-aware selection among passing candidates in CI/CD to reduce operational risk without sacrificing correctness. Artifacts are available."}

An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded. The contribution is a reproducible case study of SLO-aware control for RAG pipelines, emphasizing failure modes and reporting conventions rather than proposing a new retriever or language model."}

Corresponding authors: Zhongliang Guo and Junhao Dong", "summary": "As a critical application of computational intelligence in remote sensing, deep learning-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target recognition facilitates intelligent perception but typically relies on centralized training, where multi-source SAR data are uploaded to a single server, raising privacy and security concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $Γ$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition."}

We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret. In this work, we leverage this property further and propose the Lazy Online Forward Algorithm (LOFA), which achieves a lower empirical regret. We conduct experiments on a real-world social network to demonstrate that LOFA achieves superior performance compared to existing bandit algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and instantaneous reward."}

We show that one-in-seven moderation cases are disputed among moderators, often addressing transgressions where users' intent is not directly legible, such as in trolling and brigading, as well as tensions around community governance. This is concerning, as almost half of all gray area cases involved automated moderation decisions. Through information-theoretic evaluations, we demonstrate that gray area cases are inherently harder to adjudicate than undisputed cases and show that state-of-the-art language models struggle to adjudicate them. We highlight the key role of expert human moderators in overseeing the moderation process and provide insights about the challenges of current moderation processes and tools."}

Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling.

We propose an approach to enhance planning with JEPA world models by shaping their representation space so that the negative goal-conditioned value function for a reaching cost in a given environment is approximated by a distance (or quasi-distance) between state embeddings. We introduce a practical method to enforce this constraint during training and show that it leads to significantly improved planning performance compared to standard JEPA models on simple control tasks."}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs."}

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections."}

As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust.

Existing automated untangling methods, particularly state-of-the-art graph clustering-based approaches, are fundamentally limited by two issues. (1) They over-rely on structural information, failing to grasp the crucial semantic intent behind changes, and (2) they operate as ``single-pass'' algorithms, lacking a mechanism for the critical reflection and refinement inherent in human review processes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Atomizer, a novel collaborative multi-agent framework for composite commit untangling. To address the semantic deficit, Atomizer employs an Intent-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (IO-CoT) strategy, which prompts large language models (LLMs) to infer the intent of each code change according to both the structure and the semantic information of code. To overcome the limitations of ``single-pass'' grouping, we employ two agents to establish a grouper-reviewer collaborative refinement loop, which mirrors human review practices by iteratively refining groupings until all changes in a cluster share the same underlying semantic intent. Extensive experiments on two benchmark C# and Java datasets demonstrate that Atomizer significantly outperforms several representative baselines. On average, it surpasses the state-of-the-art graph-based methods by over 6.0% on the C# dataset and 5.5% on the Java dataset. This superiority is particularly pronounced on complex commits, where Atomizer's performance advantage widens to over 16%."}

MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs. These results establish execution governance as a foundational layer in ML systems infrastructure, orthogonal to model-level optimization techniques."}

Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically.

In this work, we propose CatchAll, a novel LLM-based approach for repository-aware exception handling. CatchAll equips LLMs with three complementary layers of exception-handling knowledge: (1) API-level exception knowledge, obtained from an empirically constructed API-exception mapping that characterizes the exception-throwing behaviors of APIs in real-world codebases; (2) repository-level execution context, which captures exception propagation by modeling contextual call traces around the target code; and (3) cross-repository handling knowledge, distilled from reusable exception-handling patterns mined from historical code across projects. The knowledge is encoded into structured prompts to guide the LLM in generating accurate and context-aware exception-handling code. To evaluate CatchAll, we construct two new benchmarks for repository-aware exception handling: a large-scale dataset RepoExEval and an executable subset RepoExEval-Exec. Experiments demonstrate that RepoExEval consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a CodeBLEU score of 0.31 (vs. 0.27% for the best baseline), intent prediction accuracy of 60.1% (vs. 48.0%), and Pass@1 of 29% (vs. 25%). These results affirm RepoExEval's effectiveness in real-world repository-level exception handling."}

We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences."}

Each experiment is executed in a controlled Colab environment instrumented with the CodeCarbon toolkit to quantify power draw and equivalent CO2 output during both training and inference. We construct an Eco Efficiency Index that expresses F1 score per kilowatt hour to capture the trade off between detection quality and environmental impact. Results reveal that optimized Random Forest and lightweight Logistic Regression models achieve the highest eco efficiency, reducing energy consumption by more than forty percent compared to XGBoost while sustaining competitive detection accuracy.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction.

This evolution has brought GPU security and reliability to the forefront of concerns. Prior research has shown that CUDA's lack of memory safety can lead to serious vulnerabilities. While fuzzing is effective for finding such bugs on CPUs, equivalent tools for GPUs are lacking due to architectural differences and lack of built-in error detection. In this paper, we propose CuFuzz, a novel compiler-runtime co-design solution to extend state-of-the-art CPU fuzzing tools to GPU programs. CuFuzz transforms GPU programs into CPU programs using compiler IR-level transformations to enable effective fuzz testing. To the best of our knowledge, CuFuzz is the first mechanism to bring fuzzing support to CUDA, addressing a critical gap in GPU security research. By leveraging CPU memory error detectors such as Address Sanitizer, CuFuzz aims to uncover memory safety bugs and related correctness vulnerabilities in CUDA code, enhancing the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated applications. To ensure high fuzzing throughput, we introduce two compiler-runtime co-optimizations tailored for GPU code: Partial Representative Execution (PREX) and Access-Index Preserving Pruning (AXIPrune), achieving average throughput improvements of 32x with PREX and an additional 33% gain with AXIPrune on top of PREX-optimized code.

More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important."}

These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches. The framework maintains sub-second aggregation latency suitable for real-time applications and provides 256-bit post-quantum security level."}

We introduce a non-destructive screening method that uses power side-channel measurements and generative modeling to detect tampering in commodity microcontrollers without trusted hardware. As a proof-of-concept, differential power analysis (DPA) traces are collected from the ChipWhisperer and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained only on benign measurements to learn nominal power behavior. The trained discriminator then serves as a one-class anomaly detector. We report detection performance on multiple tampering scenarios and discuss how this technique can serve as an intermediate screening tier between basic functional tests and high-cost forensic analysis.

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations.

In group review requests, available on platforms like Phabricator, GitHub, and Bitbucket, a code change is assigned to a reviewer group, allowing any member to review it, unlike individual review assignments to specific reviewers. Drawing parallels with shared task queues in Management Sciences, this study examines the effects of group versus individual review requests on velocity and quality. We investigate approximately 66,000 revisions in the Mozilla Firefox project, combining statistical modeling with practitioner views from a focus group discussion. Our study associates group reviews with improved review quality, characterized by fewer regressions, while having a negligible association with review velocity. Additional perceived benefits include balanced work distribution and training opportunities for new reviewers."}

However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems."}

To address these risks, governments and industry stakeholders are turning toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC), a class of algorithms designed to resist adversaries equipped with quantum computing capabilities. However, existing studies provide limited insight into the implementation-focused aspects of PQC in the ITS domain. This review fills that gap by evaluating the readiness of vehicular communication and security standards for PQC adoption. It examines in-vehicle networks and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) interfaces, while also investigating vulnerabilities at the physical layer, primarily exposure to side-channel and fault injection attacks. The review identifies thirteen research gaps reflecting non-PQC-ready standards, constraints in embedded implementation and hybrid cryptography, interoperability and certificate-management barriers, lack of real-world PQC deployment data in ITS, and physical-attack vulnerabilities in PQC-enabled vehicular communication. Future research directions include updating vehicular communication and security standards, optimizing PQC for low-power devices, enhancing interoperability and certificate-management frameworks for PQC integration, conducting real-world evaluations of PQC-enabled communication and control functions across ITS deployments, and strengthening defenses against AI-assisted physical attacks. A phased roadmap is presented, aligning PQC deployment with regulatory, performance, and safety requirements, thereby guiding the secure evolution of ITS in the quantum computing era."}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales."}

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment."}

Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches."}

Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of machine learning methodologies with the EVO Algorithm. The Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) effectively diminished features in the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset from 88 to 38 and in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data from 80 to 43, significantly enhancing computing efficiency. HyIDS incorporates four Machine Learning (ML) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (D_Tree), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed HyIDS was assessed utilizing two real-world intrusion datasets, CIC-DDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, both distinguished by considerable class imbalances. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset has a significant imbalance between DDoS assault samples and legal traffic, while the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset primarily comprises benign traffic with insufficient representation of attack types, complicating the detection of minority attacks. A downsampling technique was employed to balance the datasets, hence improving detection efficacy for both benign and malicious traffic. Twenty-four trials were done, revealing substantial enhancements in categorization accuracy, precision, and recall. Our suggested D_TreeEVO model attained an accuracy rate of 99.13% and an F1 score of 98.94% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and an accuracy rate of 99.78% and an F1 score of 99.70% on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data.

Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next.

The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models.

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models."}

I evaluate supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO variants on a small held-out prompt set from APPS+ and observe that PPO with partial credit (using a continued-training variant) improves syntax validity from 45% (SFT) to 60% and achieves the only non-zero test success signal in this pilot evaluation (5% at-least-one-test-pass), while remaining 100% clean under Bandit static analysis. Although Bandit findings were absent in this small evaluation, the security term is integrated into training to discourage insecure shortcuts when they appear."}

To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not.

This study investigates quantum machine learning approaches for detecting coordinated stealth attacks on a distributed generation unit in a microgrid. High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware. In contrast, hybrid models train more reliably and demonstrate that quantum feature mapping can enhance intrusion detection even when fully quantum learning is not yet practical."}

We present Arca, a lightweight confidential container framework based on a TEE-in-Container architecture that isolates each workload in an independent, hardware-enforced trust domain while keeping orchestration logic outside the TEE. This design minimizes inter-layer dependencies, confines compromise to per-container boundaries, and restores the TEE's minimal trust principle. We implemented Arca on Intel SGX, Intel TDX, and AMD SEV. Experimental results show that Arca achieves near-native performance and outperforms CoCo in most benchmarks, while the reduced TCB significantly improves verifiability and resilience against host-level compromise. Arca emonstrates that efficient container management and strong runtime confidentiality can be achieved without sacrificing security assurance."}

However, what constitutes a \"defect\" is inherently context-dependent and varies across projects, domains, and stakeholder interpretations. In this paper, we propose a Human-LLM Collaboration (HLC) approach that treats defect prediction as an adaptive process rather than a static classification task. HLC leverages LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a feedback loop: users validate predictions alongside their explanations, and these validated examples adaptively guide future predictions through few-shot learning. We evaluate this approach using the weak word smell on the QuRE benchmark of 1,266 annotated Mercedes-Benz requirements. Our results show that HLC effectively adapts to the provision of validated examples, with rapid performance gains from as few as 20 validated examples. Incorporating validated explanations, not just labels, enables HLC to substantially outperform both standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuned BERT models while maintaining high recall. These results highlight how the in-context and Chain-of-Thought learning capabilities of LLMs enable adaptive classification approaches that move beyond one-size-fits-all models, creating opportunities for tools that learn continuously from stakeholder feedback."}

Rizki Oktavian"], "title": "LLMize: A Framework for Large Language Model-Based Numerical Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize."}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations."}

We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching. Case studies on three representative tools show that MCP-SandboxScan can surface provenance evidence when external inputs appear in prompt/messages or tool-return payloads, and can expose filesystem capability violations as runtime evidence. We further compare against a lightweight static string-signature baseline and use a micro-benchmark to characterize false negatives under transformations and false positives from short-token collisions."}

First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported.

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello."}

This paper bridges this research gap by operationalizing regulatory compliance as a quantitative and dynamic trust metric through our novel automated compliance engine (ACE). ACE first formalizes legal and organizational policies into a verifiable, obligation-centric logic. It then continuously audits system event logs against this logic to detect violations. The core of our contribution is a quantitative model that assesses the severity of each violation along multiple dimensions, including its Volume, Duration, Breadth, and Criticality, to compute a fine-grained, evolving compliance score. We evaluate ACE on a synthetic hospital dataset, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect a range of complex HIPAA and GDPR violations and produce a nuanced score that is significantly more expressive than traditional binary approaches. This work enables the development of more transparent, accountable, and resilient TRMSs on the Web."}

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings.

To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation.

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25° resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models."}

IoT firmware frequently relies on outdated, third-party libraries embedded within monolithic binary blobs, making vulnerability management difficult. While Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards have matured, generating actionable intelligence from raw firmware dumps remains a manual and error-prone process. This paper presents a lightweight, automated pipeline designed to extract file systems from Linux-based IoT firmware, generate a comprehensive SBOM, map identified components to known vulnerabilities, and apply a multi-factor triage scoring model. The proposed system focuses on risk prioritization by integrating signals from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Unlike conventional scanners that produce high volumes of uncontextualized alerts, this approach emphasizes triage by calculating a localized risk score for each finding. We describe the architecture, the normalization challenges of embedded Linux, and a scoring methodology intended to reduce alert fatigue. The study outlines a planned evaluation strategy to validate the extraction success rate and triage efficacy using a dataset of public vendor firmware, offering a reproducibility framework for future research in firmware security."}

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications."}

To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance.

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation.

At its core, OpenRT architects a paradigm shift in automated red-teaming by introducing an adversarial kernel that enables modular separation across five critical dimensions: model integration, dataset management, attack strategies, judging methods, and evaluation metrics.

We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity."}

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations."}

A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection. Our findings reveal that AI agent security is fundamentally a structural problem: attack semantics reside in execution patterns, not surface language. While our rule-based tokenizer serves as a baseline, the structural abstraction principle generalizes even with simple implementation."}

We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching. Case studies on three representative tools show that MCP-SandboxScan can surface provenance evidence when external inputs appear in prompt/messages or tool-return payloads, and can expose filesystem capability violations as runtime evidence. We further compare against a lightweight static string-signature baseline and use a micro-benchmark to characterize false negatives under transformations and false positives from short-token collisions."}

To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning."}

To address this, we propose LaDP, a novel layer-wise adaptive noise injection mechanism for FL that optimizes privacy protection while preserving model accuracy. LaDP leverages two key insights: (1) neural network layers contribute unevenly to model utility, and (2) layer-wise privacy leakage can be quantified via KL divergence between local and global model distributions. LaDP dynamically injects noise into selected layers based on their privacy sensitivity and importance to model performance.\n  We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that LaDP satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP guarantees and converges under bounded noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 datasets demonstrate that LaDP reduces noise injection by 46.14% on average compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving accuracy by 102.99%. Under the same privacy budget, LaDP outperforms SOTA solutions like Dynamic Privacy Allocation LDP and AdapLDP by 25.18% and 6.1% in accuracy, respectively.

This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%.

Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express."}

These systems depend on functioning networks to reach online authorities, resolvers, directories, and revocation services, leaving trust unverifiable whenever communication is unavailable or untrusted. This work demonstrates that secure identity and trust are possible without such infrastructure. We introduce the Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph (ZI-CG), a model showing that identity, delegation, and revocation can be represented as self-contained, signed statements whose validity is determined entirely by local, deterministic evaluation. We further present Vouchsafe, a complete working instantiation of this model built using widely deployed primitives including Ed25519, SHA-256, and structured JSON Web Tokens, requiring no new cryptography or online services. The results show that a practical, offline-verifiable trust substrate can be constructed today using only the cryptographic data presented at evaluation time."}

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability."}

Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.\n  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters."}

Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training. Theoretically, we derive an attribution-aware lower bound on adversarial distortion that formalizes the link between explanation alignment and robustness.

Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol. Notably, on GiftEval we observe a \"student-beats-teacher\" effect: models trained on our simulations exceed the forecasting accuracy of the AutoARIMA generating processes."}

Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%.

Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline.

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning."}

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure."}

The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning."}

In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains."}

We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance.

However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.\n  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities."}

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory."}

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation."}

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{5/4} c_μ^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{2} c_μ^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_μ$ and $c_μ$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP.

To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks."}

Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms."}

While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene. These results suggest that AI architectures aligned with biological information flow can achieve both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability."}

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity."}

However, existing screening tools - primarily developed using populations from high-income countries - often underperform in Bangladesh and South Asia, where risk profiles differ. Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets. Compared with existing screening tools, the proposed models achieved substantially higher accuracy and sensitivity while requiring fewer and more accessible inputs. External validation confirmed strong generalizability with 78% to 98% sensitivity. SHAP interpretation identified clinically meaningful predictors consistent with established CKD risk factors."}

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs."}

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development."}

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes."}

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers."}

A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance.

Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters.

Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions.

By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities.

Our approach integrates Bayesian hierarchical random forests with group-aware conformal calibration, using posterior uncertainties to weight conformity scores while maintaining rigorous coverage validity. Evaluated on 61,538 admissions across 3,793 U.S. hospitals and 4 regions, our method achieves target coverage (94.3% vs 95% target) with adaptive precision: 21% narrower intervals for low-uncertainty cases while appropriately widening for high-risk predictions. Critically, we demonstrate that well-calibrated Bayesian uncertainties alone severely under-cover (14.1%), highlighting the necessity of our hybrid approach. This framework enables risk-stratified clinical protocols, efficient resource planning for high-confidence predictions, and conservative allocation with enhanced oversight for uncertain cases, providing uncertainty-aware decision support across diverse healthcare settings."}

A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.\n  Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting engagement."}

The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion."}

The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization.

A central requirement of $μ$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $μ$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $μ$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $μ$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $μ$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training.

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity."}

Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety."}

However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning."}

Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis."}

This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins."}

This study presents a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-informed heuristics to systematically analyze and quantify affective polarization in discussions on divisive topics such as climate change and gun control.

We then apply a rule-based scoring system capable of quantifying affective polarization even in small conversations consisting of single interactions, based on stance alignment, emotional content, and interaction dynamics. Our analysis reveals distinct polarization patterns that are event dependent: (i) anticipation-driven polarization, where extreme polarization escalates before well-publicized events, and (ii) reactive polarization, where intense affective polarization spikes immediately after sudden, high-impact events. By combining AI-driven content annotation with domain-informed scoring, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to measuring affective polarization.

To enhance model performance under variable system scales and improve robustness in branch power prediction, this paper proposes a Scale-adaptive Multi-task Power Flow Analysis (SaMPFA) framework. SaMPFA introduces a Local Topology Slicing (LTS) sampling technique that extracts subgraphs of different scales from the complete power network to strengthen the model's cross-scale learning capability. Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial grid in China demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior adaptability and generalization under variable system scales, with accuracy improvements of 4.47% and 36.82%, respectively."}

GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%.

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure."}

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $Ω(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning."}

We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant."}

However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_k}\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure. Finally, we study the optimization process and prove the convergence guarantee under the MoLR-MoG modeling. Combined with these results, under a setting close to real-world data, this work explains why diffusion models only require a small training sample and enjoy a fast optimization process to achieve a great performance."}

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers."}

This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality.

With a deliberately designed update, OLDSGD preserves the same average update as Local SGD while avoiding communication-induced stalls. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for smooth non-convex objectives, showing that OLDSGD retains the same iteration complexity as standard Local Decentralized SGD while improving per-iteration runtime.

We then situate MBIA within a broader ecosystem by building a historical interaction network spanning more than 2,000 subreddits, which enables us to trace cross-community pathways and measure how toxicity and emotional expression vary across these trajectories. We find that MBIA users primarily traverse four surrounding community spheres (AI-companionship, porn-related, forum-like, and gaming) and that participation across the ecosystem exhibits a distinct gendered structure, with substantial engagement by female users. While toxicity is generally low across most pathways, we observe localized spikes concentrated in a small subset of AI-porn and gender-oriented communities. Nearly 16% of users engage with gender-focused subreddits, and their trajectories display systematically different patterns of emotional expression and elevated toxicity, suggesting that a minority of gendered pathways may act as toxicity amplifiers within the broader AI-companionship ecosystem.

In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion.

In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes."}

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs."}

We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $π_{sample}$ while leaving $π_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails. We also empirically validate our theoretical predictions on arithmetic reasoning demonstrates that RL's superior generalization stems primarily from improved decision-making ($π_{d}$) rather than sampling capabilities, providing a first-principles mechanistic explanation for self-correction in thinking models."}

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes."}

This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$.

Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections."}

Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment."}

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

We propose DiMEx, a framework that weaponizes the rich semantic priors of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to bypass this initialization barrier entirely. By employing Random Embedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) within the generator's latent space, DiMEx synthesizes high-fidelity queries immediately, achieving 52.1 percent agreement on SVHN with just 2,000 queries - outperforming state-of-the-art GAN baselines by over 16 percent.

To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency. At each time step, a bipartite graph is generated to identify a subset of effective models, from which a model is selected to construct the prediction set.

Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection."}

Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety."}

In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries. We also evaluate EPIC on mathematical reasoning, where it outperforms all baselines."}

In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins."}

Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms."}

This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws.

In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios.

The diverse and rapidly evolving data patterns pose significant challenges for online anomaly detection. Many existing anomaly detection methods are designed for offline settings or have difficulty in handling heterogeneous streaming data effectively. This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%. In addition, its ensemble strategy provides superior detection performance compared with both individual models and average ensembles, with competitive computational efficiency."}

To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models.

Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os.

As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."}

We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $π_{sample}$ while leaving $π_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails. We also empirically validate our theoretical predictions on arithmetic reasoning demonstrates that RL's superior generalization stems primarily from improved decision-making ($π_{d}$) rather than sampling capabilities, providing a first-principles mechanistic explanation for self-correction in thinking models."}

These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy."}

To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy."}

These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection."}

Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup."}

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"}

To address this, we introduce a novel concept called quantile distortion, which enables non-uniform pessimism by adjusting the degree of conservatism based on the availability of supporting data. Our approach is grounded in theoretical analysis and empirically validated, demonstrating improved performance over uniform pessimism."}

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment."}

This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability. We propose two LLM-driven mutation strategies in which the model itself mutates the training data, either by altering contextual details or by directly modifying problem structure. We find that the model can generate novel and meaningful problems, and that these LLM-driven mutations improve RL training.

As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."}

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."}

We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (β= 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (β= 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (β= 0.547, p < 0.001).

In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment."}

Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach."}

In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss.

The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking."}

As SMOTE is one of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue, it is imperative to validate it not only empirically but also theoretically. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of SMOTE's convergence properties. Concretely, we prove that the synthetic random variable Z converges in probability to the underlying random variable X. We further prove a stronger convergence in mean when X is compact. Finally, we show that lower values of the nearest neighbor rank lead to faster convergence offering actionable guidance to practitioners. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments using both real-life and synthetic data. Our work provides a foundational understanding that enhances data augmentation techniques beyond imbalanced data scenarios."}

While multi-model methods based on selection or ensembling outperform single-model ones, they still face limitations: (i) selection methods rely on a single chosen model and are sensitive to the strategy; (ii) ensembling methods often combine all models or are restricted to univariate data; and (iii) most methods depend on fixed data dimensionality, limiting scalability. To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection. The framework first (i) constructs a diverse model pool via parameter transfer and diversity metric, then (ii) updates it with a meta-model and similarity-based strategy for adaptive pool expansion, subset selection, and pool merging, finally (iii) ensembles top-ranked models through proxy metric ranking and top-k aggregation in the selected subset, outputting the final anomaly detection result. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model outperforms all baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and scalability."}

However, most approaches rely on static datasets, which have been suggested to encourage memorisation and limit generalisation. We introduce DéjàQ, a framework that departs from this paradigm by jointly evolving a diverse set of synthetic mathematical problems alongside model training. This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability. We propose two LLM-driven mutation strategies in which the model itself mutates the training data, either by altering contextual details or by directly modifying problem structure. We find that the model can generate novel and meaningful problems, and that these LLM-driven mutations improve RL training. We analyse key aspects of DéjàQ, including the validity of generated problems and computational overhead. Our results underscore the potential of dynamically evolving training data to enhance mathematical reasoning and indicate broader applicability, which we will support by open-sourcing our code."}

By rescuing the \"dead\" neurons from the saturation zone of the activation function, we enhance the model's expressive capacity. Our analysis reveals that ENSO predictability emerges dominantly from the tropical Pacific, with contributions from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, consistent with physical understanding. Controlled experiments affirm the robustness of our method and its alignment with established predictors.

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."}

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning."}

A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss."}

To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families."}

We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$ρ$) by 7.7% on average.

Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines."}

To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design.

Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space.

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation."}

These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters."}

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility."}

This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines.

Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research."}

We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios.

Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $Γ$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition."}

Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains."}

Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches. The framework maintains sub-second aggregation latency suitable for real-time applications and provides 256-bit post-quantum security level."}

Despite the advances of LLM-powered code review comment generation approaches, several practical challenges remain for designing enterprise-grade code review automation tools. In particular, this paper aims at answering the practical question: how can we design a review-guided, context-aware, quality-checked code review comment generation without fine-tuning?\n  In this paper, we present RovoDev Code Reviewer, an enterprise-grade LLM-based code review automation tool designed and deployed at scale within Atlassian's development ecosystem with seamless integration into Atlassian's Bitbucket. Through the offline, online, user feedback evaluations over a one-year period, we conclude that RovoDev Code Reviewer is (1) effective in generating code review comments that could lead to code resolution for 38.70% (i.e., comments that triggered code changes in the subsequent commits); and (2) offers the promise of accelerating feedback cycles (i.e., decreasing the PR cycle time by 30.8%), alleviating reviewer workload (i.e., reducing the number of human-written comments by 35.6%), and improving overall software quality (i.e., finding errors with actionable suggestions)."}

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello."}

However, existing research in legal judgment generation has predominantly focused on first-instance trials, relying on static fact-to-verdict mappings while neglecting the dialectical nature of appellate (second-instance) review. To address this, we introduce AppellateGen, a benchmark for second-instance legal judgment generation comprising 7,351 case pairs. The task requires models to draft legally binding judgments by reasoning over the initial verdict and evidentiary updates, thereby modeling the causal dependency between trial stages. We further propose a judicial Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)-based Legal Multi-Agent System (SLMAS) to simulate judicial workflows, which decomposes the generation process into discrete stages of issue identification, retrieval, and drafting. Experimental results indicate that while SLMAS improves logical consistency, the complexity of appellate reasoning remains a substantial challenge for current LLMs. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AppellateGen-5763."}

We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a \"cognitive buffer,\" they may exhibit \"Defensive OverThinking\" under adversarial pressure. Furthermore, we introduce the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to verify that conviction does not compromise safety. This work serves as a blueprint for measuring AI scientific integrity."}

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"}

Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.\n  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters."}
