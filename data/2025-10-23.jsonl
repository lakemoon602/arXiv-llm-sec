We introduce a 3D optimization\nframework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified\ndecision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large\nlanguage models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO\nshapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling\nenvironmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k.

It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning.

Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In\nthis position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --\nthose computed on trained networks -- are \\textbf{fragile}: small training\nmodifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a\nmeasure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop.

We\nshow that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities prior to the decision layer.

Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying\nentire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical\n(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain\nstealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers\napproaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the\ninterrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection\nby advanced defenses.

Different from other\ncommonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR\ndynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy\ngradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure\nstealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number\nof modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints.

However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods).

Traditional shortest-path routing often\ncauses congestion and overheating in specific nodes, leading to early failures.\nTo address these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent temperature-aware\nand reliability-based routing approach that enhances WBAN performance. The\nproposed method works in two phases: (1) network setup and intelligent path\nselection, and (2) dynamic traffic management and hotspot avoidance. In the\nfirst phase, nodes share information such as residual energy, temperature, link\nreliability, and delay to build an optimized topology using a multi-criteria\ndecision algorithm.

We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation\nframework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary\ndimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive\nUncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty.

In the current paradigm of training\ntransformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,\nvisual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans\ncan maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.\nSignificant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is\nirrelevant and can be abstracted.

We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format.

Yet, applying RL in\noff-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for\ntraining--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy\ndeclines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)\nan imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the\npolicy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;\nand (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping\nmechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing\nupdates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of\nexploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that\ndynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and\nnegative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across\ndiverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO\nachieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules\nin LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied\nindependently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio\nconstraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules\nbecomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms\nand mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.\nHowever, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic\nalgorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while\nmask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between\nsingular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current\nmethods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a\ncompression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal\nlocal minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation\n(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that\nenables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable\nparameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter\nselection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a\n80\\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42\nand improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared\nwith uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our\nmethod for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression."}

During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary\nbottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory\nconsumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform\nquantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high\ndequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we\npropose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel\nquantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better\ncaptures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the\ncomputational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating\ndequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms\nand can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For\nefficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for\nend-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces\nperplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training\nquantization, completing quantization within one hour.

While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025.

However, traditional evacuation simulation\nrelies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it\nchallenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design\nstages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building\nevacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation\nsimulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse\nfunctional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was\nestablished. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed\nphysical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a\ndiffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns\nfrom simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using\nConditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%\nimprovement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,\nthereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate\nthat the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design\niteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also\noffers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in\nintelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach\nlowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and\nfacilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools."}

This paper examines the\ntechnical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in\nBrazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy\navailability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies\naccelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150\ndays), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,\nand regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our\nfindings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and\nelectrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by\nhardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a\ntotal cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million\nUSD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training\ntimelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,\nenabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models\nwithout competing at the global frontier.

However, the\nobjective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning\nobjective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good\nplanning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future\nframes as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic\ninformation about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward\nhacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They\nachieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting\nspurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)\nthat correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than\ngenuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by\nthe invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based\nReward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant\nkernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental\nresults in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the\naccuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces\nthe dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust\nframework for preference-based alignment."}

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art\nmodel-level defenses without any adaptive optimization.
