The\nalgorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large\nsuperpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule\nto guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --\nincorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem\nHamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is\nupdated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,\nwhich iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the\nspin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies\nglobal minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO\ninstances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku\npuzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with\nlong-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the\nalgorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving\ninstances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages\nof this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,\nand suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications."}

Prompt injection attacks\ncan cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit\nharmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are\nevaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\"\nmodel argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the\nprompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final\nclassification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct\nDetector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt\ninjection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the\nimportance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the\nclassification of a prompt.

To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we\ndevelop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT\nobfuscation.

The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI\nintegration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data\nsources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for\nseamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this\nconcern, we propose \"MCC: Model Context Contracts\" a novel framework that\nenables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through\nMCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart\ncontracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between\nusers and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with\nblockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language.\nWithin this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as\nintelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and\nexecuting the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately\ninterprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP\nfunctions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs\npaired with their corresponding MCP server functions.

We first model the dependencies among all\nsub-tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and design a two-timescale frame\nstructure to decouple the sub-task interdependencies for sub-task scheduling.\nThen, a joint sub-task offloading, computational resource allocation, and UAV\ntrajectories optimization problem is formulated, which aims to minimize the\nsystem cost, i.e., the weighted sum of the task completion delay and the system\nenergy consumption. To solve this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) problem, a penalty dual decomposition and successive convex\napproximation (PDD-SCA) algorithm is developed. Particularly, the original\nMINLP problem is equivalently transferred into a continuous form relying on PDD\ntheory.

The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G\nsystems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman\n(DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G\nnetworks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent\nengineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a\nquantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear\npathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment\n(UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the\nNIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation\nMechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and\napplies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC\n(HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe\nprimitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental\nvalidation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance\noverhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of\ncarrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and\nSA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as\nwell as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for\nmitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and\nintegrity of network data."}

This undermines their central purpose -- providing\ndiverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations\n-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc\nregularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model\nprototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,\nindependent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling\neliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields\nconsistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance."}

To\naddress these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play\nmethodology named\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\\underline{\\textbf{G}}$uided\nSelf-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,\nby simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along\nwith an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical\nanalysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the\nperformance of existing methods."}

This\nstudy proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.\nFollowing a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is\ndecomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of\nnon-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of\nlight-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to\nhandle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by\ntransforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.\nComprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating\nrainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over\nconventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods.

This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed.

Existing graph\nneural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring\nseparate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders\nscalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for\nLatent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature\nencoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared\nmodality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal\nattributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that\naggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node\nrepresentation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,\nwhere it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while\nreducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and\nenables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way\ntoward foundation models for relational graph data."}

However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the\nperformance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a\nchallenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance\nexecution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a\nheterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate\nprivacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to\nuntrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts\nan information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:\nsecurity-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of\nattention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an\nSGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are\nperformed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the\nenclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and\nevaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that\nSecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,\noffering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference."}

For example, a tweet\ncontaining a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that\ncelebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could\nconceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible\nthanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and\nefficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter\nopen-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message\nas long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in\nseconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of\ntext from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,\nalready shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete\nscenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its\nanswers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises\nurgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it\nmeans for a Large Language Model to know something."}

Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have\nquickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the\ninfrastructure in a \"source-of-truth\" configuration. They are capable of\nautomatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,\nor destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment\nwith the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,\nor SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure\ndrift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may\nundo valid updates or trigger errors.\n  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates\nout-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that\ninfrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the\nlowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API\ntraces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update\nthe IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic\narchitecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API\nsequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and\ncontinually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past\nreconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting\nrealistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation\nperformance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372\ndrift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of\naccuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\\times$\nimprovement)."}
