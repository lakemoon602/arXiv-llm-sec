Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts."}

Considering the risk of leakage or misuse by any of the data-owners, many works attempt to protect their copyright, or even trace the origin of a potential leak through unique watermarks identifying each participant's model copy. Realistic accusation scenarios impose a black-box setting, where watermarks are typically embedded as a set of sample-label pairs. The threat of collusion, however, where multiple bad actors conspire together to produce an untraceable model, has been rarely addressed, and previous works have been limited to shallow networks and near-linearly separable main tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present a general collusion-resistant embedding method for black-box traitor tracing in Federated Learning: BlackCATT, which introduces a novel collusion-aware embedding loss term and, instead of using a fixed trigger set, iteratively optimizes the triggers to aid convergence and traitor tracing performance. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed scheme across different architectures and datasets. Furthermore, for models that would otherwise suffer from update incompatibility on the main task after learning different watermarks (e.g., architectures including batch normalization layers), our proposed BlackCATT+FR incorporates functional regularization through a set of auxiliary examples at the aggregator, promoting a shared feature space among model copies without compromising traitor tracing performance."}

Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses."}

While the trade-off between accuracy and differential privacy is well-understood, the inherent cost of privacy regarding memory use remains largely unexplored. This paper establishes for the first time an unconditional space lower bound for user-level differential privacy by introducing a novel proof technique based on a multi-player communication game.\n  Central to our approach, this game formally links the hardness of low-memory private algorithms to the necessity of ``contribution capping'' -- tracking and limiting the users who disproportionately impact the dataset. We demonstrate that winning this communication game requires transmitting information proportional to the number of over-active users, which translates directly to memory lower bounds.\n  We apply this framework, as an example, to the fundamental problem of estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream and we prove that any private algorithm requires almost $\\widetildeΩ(T^{1/3})$ space to achieve certain error rates in a promise variant of the problem. This resolves an open problem in the literature (by Jain et al. NeurIPS 2023 and Cummings et al. ICML 2025) and establishes the first exponential separation between the space complexity of private algorithms and their non-private $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ counterparts for a natural statistical estimation task. Furthermore, we show that this communication-theoretic technique generalizes to broad classes of problems, yielding lower bounds for private medians, quantiles, and max-select."}

It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens."}

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}

However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors."}

In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again. Our findings offer the first evidence-based characterization of AI agents effects on OSS mobile projects and establish empirical baselines for evaluating agent-generated contributions to design platform aware agentic systems."}

Jean Camp"], "title": "Community Concealment from Unsupervised Graph Learning-Based Clustering", "comment": null, "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning."}

Code available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaostudy/star", "summary": "As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model."}

Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}
