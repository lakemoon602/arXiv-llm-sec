Accepted for publication at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS) 2025. The final peer-reviewed version is available at: http://hdl.handle.net/10453/190882", "summary": "Research on the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education often focuses on strategic goals, overlooking the hidden, and often politically charged, labour required to make it functional. This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets \"articulation work\" as a form of \"invisible labour\". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for \"unfinished\" systems can simultaneously create unofficial \"shadow\" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice."}

This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support."}

Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy.

Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems."}

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms.

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms."}

We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization."}

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures."}

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation."}

We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

These flaws come from mistakes in an application's design or implementation and allow attackers to trigger unintended application behavior. Traditional fuzzing sanitizers for dynamic analysis excel at finding vulnerabilities related to memory safety violations but largely fail to detect business logic vulnerabilities, as these flaws require understanding application-specific semantic context. Recent attempts to infer this context, due to their reliance on heuristics and non-portable language features, are inherently brittle and incomplete. As business logic vulnerabilities constitute a majority (27/40) of the most dangerous software weaknesses in practice, this is a worrying blind spot of existing tools. In this paper, we tackle this challenge with ANOTA, a novel human-in-the-loop sanitizer framework. ANOTA introduces a lightweight, user-friendly annotation system that enables users to directly encode their domain-specific knowledge as lightweight annotations that define an application's intended behavior. A runtime execution monitor then observes program behavior, comparing it against the policies defined by the annotations, thereby identifying deviations that indicate vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of ANOTA, we combine ANOTA with a state-of-the-art fuzzer and compare it against other popular bug finding methods compatible with the same targets. The results show that ANOTA+FUZZER outperforms them in terms of effectiveness. More specifically, ANOTA+FUZZER can successfully reproduce 43 known vulnerabilities, and discovered 22 previously unknown vulnerabilities (17 CVEs assigned) during the evaluation. These results demonstrate that ANOTA provides a practical and effective approach for uncovering complex business logic flaws often missed by traditional security testing techniques."}

Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints."}

This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone."}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora."}

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology."}

These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.\n  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks."}

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines."}

Traditional security approaches have focused on providing specific and attack-tailored solutions that will not properly meet the uncertainties driven by a technology yet under development and showing an attack surface not completely identified either. In this positioning paper we propose a softwarized solution, defining a Security Plane built on a top of programmable and adaptable set of live Security Functions under a proactive strategy. In addition, in order to address the inaccuracies driven by the predictive models a pre-assessment scenario is also considered ensuring that no action will be deployed if not previously verified. Although more efforts are required to develop this initiative, we think that such a shift paradigm is the only way to face security provisioning challenges in 6G ecosystems."}

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation.

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy."}

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments."}

To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems."}

Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures.

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Among these, detection methods based on internal IMU sensors are regarded as some of the most effective. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack system designed to neutralize IMU sensor-based detection. First, we present an attack modeling approach for bypassing such detection. Then, based on EKF sensor fusion, we experimentally analyze both the impact of GPS spoofing values on the internal target system and how our proposed methodology reduces anomaly detection within the target system. To this end, this paper proposes an attack model that performs GPS spoofing by stealing internal dynamic state information using an external IMU sensor, and the experimental results demonstrate that attack values can be injected without being detected."}

As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness.\n  In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack.

Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads.

Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios.

However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch.

In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning."}

To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance.

In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning."}

This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support."}

We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks.

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code.

These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world."}

We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence."}

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift."}

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice."}

The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution.

With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%.

The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience."}

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems."}

We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution."}

Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts.

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques.

While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed.

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level."}

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation."}

However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.\n  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks."}

Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times.

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology."}

We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning.

We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines."}

We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers.

Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget."}

We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model."}

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\\%."}

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation."}

Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets."}

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management."}

We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks.

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems."}

Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence."}

In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals.

We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.\n  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks."}

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency."}

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU."}

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima.

By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker.

However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space.

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results."}

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces.

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments."}

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge."}

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures."}

To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation."}

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets."}

This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines."}

Camera-ready submission", "summary": "Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets. BCG is publicly available at https://erdemub.github.io/BCG-dataset."}

Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution."}

However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications."}

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy."}

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency."}

This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels."}

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging."}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments."}
