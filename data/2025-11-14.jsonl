We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online."}

We introduce a novel community detection method, based on Ricci flow on graphs. Our technique iteratively updates edge weights (their metric lengths) according to their (combinatorial) Foster version of Ricci curvature computed from effective resistance distance between the nodes. The latter computation is known to be done by pseudo-inverting the graph Laplacian matrix. At that, our approach is alternative to one based on Ollivier-Ricci geometric flow for community detection on graphs, significantly outperforming it in terms of computation time. In our proposed method, iterations of Foster-Ricci flow that highlight network regions of different curvature -- are followed by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) separation heuristic. That allows to classify edges into ''strong'' (intra-community) and ''weak'' (inter-community) groups, followed by a systematic pruning of the former to isolate communities. We benchmark our algorithm on synthetic networks generated from the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), evaluating performance with the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Our results demonstrate that proposed framework robustly recovers the planted community structure of SBM-s, establishing Ricci-Foster Flow with GMM-clustering as a principled and computationally effective new tool for network analysis, tested against alternative Ricci-Ollivier flow coupled with spectral clustering."}

The small-budget path estimates a dismantlable subgraph fraction using a logarithmic density feature, while the large-budget path predicts the optimal partition count through a slope-based model.

On the one hand, agents are stubborn, i.e., have a tendency for one of the two opinions; on the other hand, there is a disruptive bias, $p\\in[0,1]$, that drives the agents toward the other opinion. The disruptive bias models external factors, such as market innovations or social controllers, aiming to challenge the status quo, while agents' stubbornness reinforces the initial opinion making it harder for the external bias to drive the process toward change. Each agent updates its opinion according to a nonlinear function of the states of its neighbors and of the bias $p$. We consider the case of random directed graphs with prescribed in- and out-degree sequences and we prove that the dynamics exhibits a phase transition: when the disruptive bias $p$ is larger than a critical threshold $p_c$, the population converges in constant time to a consensus on the disruptive opinion. Conversely, when the bias $p$ is less than $p_c$, the system enters a metastable state in which only a fraction of agents $q_\\star(p)<1$ will share the new opinion for a long time. We characterize $p_c$ and $q_\\star(p)$ explicitly, showing that they only depend on few simple statistics of the degree sequences. Our analysis relies on a dual system of branching, coalescing, and dying particles, which we show exhibits equivalent behavior and allows a rigorous characterization of the system's dynamics. Our results characterize the interplay between the degree of the agents, their stubbornness, and the external bias, shedding light on the tipping points of opinion dynamics in networks."}

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems."}

The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated by software systems has made effective triage indispensable for maintaining reliability, facilitating maintainability, and enabling rapid issue response. Motivated by these challenges, researchers have devoted extensive effort to advancing triage automation and have achieved significant progress over the past two decades. This survey provides a comprehensive review of 234 papers from 2004 to the present, offering an in-depth examination of the fundamental concepts, system architecture, and problem statement. By comparing the distinct goals of academic and industrial research and by analyzing empirical studies of industrial practices, we identify the major obstacles that limit the practical deployment of triage systems. To assist practitioners in method selection and performance evaluation, we summarize widely adopted open-source datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a unified perspective on the measurement of triage effectiveness.

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant.

This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting."}

Current cryptographic solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which results in heightened identification delays. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identifies devices at the physical layer, blocking impersonation attacks while significantly reducing latency. Unfortunately, multipath channels compromise RFF accuracy, and existing channel-resilient methods demand feedback or processing across multiple time points, incurring extra signaling latency. To address this problem, the paper introduces a new RFF extraction technique that employs signals from multiple receiving antennas to address multipath issues without adding latency. Unlike single-domain methods, the Log-Linear Delta Ratio (LLDR) of co-temporal channel frequency responses (CFRs) from multiple antennas is employed to preserve discriminative RFF features, eliminating multi-time sampling and reducing acquisition time. To overcome the challenge of the reliance on minimal channel variation, the frequency band is segmented into sub-bands, and the LLDR is computed within each sub-band individually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme attains a 96.13% identification accuracy for 30 user equipments (UEs) within a 20-path channel under a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the theoretical latency using the Roofline model, resulting in the air interface latency of 0.491 ms, which satisfies ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) latency requirements."}

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations."}

By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions.

Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness."}

Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies."}

The present work asks: how is justice operationalized within current child welfare administrative policy and what does it teach us about how to develop AI? We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of child welfare policy in the state of New York and find a range of functional definitions of justice (which we term principles). These principles reflect more nuanced understandings of justice across a spectrum of contexts: from established concepts like fairness and equity to less common foci like the proprietary rights of parents and children. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between AI and policy, highlighting the importance of operationalized values in adjudicating our development of ethical design requirements for high stakes decision settings."}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances.

However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes."}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search."}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead."}

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies."}

The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance."}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead."}

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies."}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning.

We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.\n  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2κ/3})$ with $O(2^{2κ/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{κ/2})$ with $O(2^κ)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.\n  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(κ+n)/2})$ ($κ$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.\n  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method."}

Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to \"weak\" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems."}

While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral.

Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\\% with 95\\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation."}

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series."}

In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants."}

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods."}

These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods."}

We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems."}

We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need."}

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency."}

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models."}

We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark."}

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently."}

Results: In this application, we introduce DeepDR, the first integrated platform that combines a variety of established DL-based models for disease- and target-specific drug repositioning tasks. DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications.

We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty."}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model."}

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation."}

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods."}

In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs."}

VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality.

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption."}

In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping.

To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation."}

We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing."}

CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%).

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning."}

Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists."}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method."}

Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency.

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)", "summary": "We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization."}

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods."}

We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size.

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency."}

To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}

As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations."}

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research."}

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty."}

For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns."}

FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data.

Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay.

Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes."}

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure!

In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks."}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters."}

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research."}

By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation."}

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies.

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local).

To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer."}

Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation.

In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging.

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction."}

Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs."}

Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition.

Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines."}

To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions."}

This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples.

To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD."}

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction."}

This is a pre-print of an accepted paper at ICDMW: SABID 2025", "summary": "Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction."}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning."}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs."}

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency."}

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth."}

Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines."}

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms."}

This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput."}

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \\textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery."}

Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs).

Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks.

We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need."}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.
