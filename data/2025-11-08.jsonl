This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework\nand taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic\nreview of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS\nmethods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to\nmulti-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow\nsequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal\ncoverage across MITRE ATT&CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance\nthrough Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely\nused datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress\ntoward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for\ndeveloping IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber\nthreats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms."}

To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training.

We propose VulInstruct, a\nspecification-guided approach that systematically extracts security\nspecifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships.

We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan.

Reflexion\nprompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from\n70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round\nfollowed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and\nNetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the\nbenefits.

However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone\nis an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV\ncaptures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to\ncapture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended\nconcept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned\nprobes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close\nto that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment.

However, they lack the capability to interpret and\nintegrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as\nmulti-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper\nintroduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a\nhybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms\nwith contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)\nagent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective\n(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against\nuser-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a\npre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a\nbenchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user\nintent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its\ninitial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining\nclassical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a\nrobust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable\nsolutions for urban mobility optimization."}

This approach also effectively\nreduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of\noverfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which\nreplaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In\na variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior\nperformance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\\times$ acceleration\nand 10$\\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.\nFurthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration\nfor a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language\nmodels feasible in resource-constrained environments.

Through systematic evaluation on\nmultiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

In contrast to conventional\nevent-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as\na general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into\ndifferent tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists\nof a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,\nconsequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.\nIn this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems\nand study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth\nallocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning\nlatency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the\ngradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the\nobtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio\nand wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under\na given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless\nbandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The\nsimulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost\nby 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level."}

Hybrid 2D radar-based\nmethods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate\nreconstruction of height-dependent dynamics.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes.

Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable.
