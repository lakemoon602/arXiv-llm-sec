Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed\nhybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine\nlearning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple\nevaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM).

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al.

These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on\nmultiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even\nthough they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A\ncommon type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an\nOD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test\ncases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.\nHowever, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not\nrelated to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is\nnecessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to\nprioritize potential order-dependent tests.

With the growing environmental impact of cloud\ncomputing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly\nimportant.\n  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on\nopen-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard\nrunners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework\nand we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to\ndate, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000\nrepositories.\n  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a\nsubstantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from\n150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most\npessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5\nkiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon\nfootprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,\nthe carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon\ncaptured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable\nto the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.\n  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted\ncomputational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in\nregions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France\nand the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for\nscheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional\nenergy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of\nrepositories."}

Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles.

The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors.

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks.

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry.

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases.

Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments.

By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy\nengine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE\nprovides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling\nsafe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended\nwith DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection,\nand QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans\nsystemic, adversarial, and ethical risks."}

While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing.

Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines."}

To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key.

Graph-based approaches have become increasingly\nimportant for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and\nstatic structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and\ntemporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by\nincorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,\nenabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data.

Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles.
