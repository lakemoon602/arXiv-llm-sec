We\ncontend that comprehensive world models must holistically integrate objective\nphysical laws with the subjective, evolving, and context-dependent nature of\nsocial dynamics. Such unification is paramount for AI to robustly navigate\ncomplex real-world challenges and achieve more generalizable intelligence. This\npaper substantiates this imperative by analyzing core impediments to\nintegration, proposing foundational guiding principles (ACE Principles), and\noutlining a conceptual framework alongside a research roadmap towards truly\nholistic world models."}

Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs\nthat can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum\nperturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the\nteacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments\nacross various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard\ndistillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples).

However, current research often adopts\ntechno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as\nreliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical\ndimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.\n  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT\ncommunities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,\nidentifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding\nof trustworthy AI systems.\n  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings\nto date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,\noperationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis\nfocuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and\nvalidation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.\n  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical\nattributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings\nreveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical\nprecision at the expense of social and ethical considerations.

NeSy AI\napproaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are\nnot well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a\nlimited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively\nintegrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing\nestablished NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic\nintegration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with\nLLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four\ndimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These\ninclude symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,\narchitectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level\nperspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge\nadvancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for\nfuture research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in\nthe literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for\nsymbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency."}

The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer\noptimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in\nkey evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison\nmodels, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual\nvalues; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination\n(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and\nstable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark\nmachine learning methods compared.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective\niterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our\nmethod repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise\nagent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,\nmasked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until\nthe input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative\ninstruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By\nallowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites\nmay fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later\nsteps.

This critical oversight\ncauses unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,\neach specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the\nshared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis\nsolvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.\nSpecifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates\nVRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state\nspaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation\ninherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.\nFurthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating\nboth the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the\npolicy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension\nprovably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture\nfunction that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state\nembeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,\nwe introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes\nbasis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and\nimplements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive\nexperiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES\nover prior methods."}

Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer\nfrom several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,\nhigh operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We\npropose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which\nmanages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We\ninvestigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and\nnon-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different\nmetrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and\nsimilarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and\nBertScore.

However,\nthe degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for\nmaximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a\nclear path to move beyond single-model systems.\n  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five\nfamilies, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering\nbenchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the\ncomplementarity between models and the performance gap between the best\nindividual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection\nheuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.\n  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be\n83% above the best single model.

To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,\nparticularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the\naccumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding\nmechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,\nand tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical\ninformation. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we\ndevelop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that\nleverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to\nassign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments\non eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,\nTMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,\nHLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both\nlabeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.
