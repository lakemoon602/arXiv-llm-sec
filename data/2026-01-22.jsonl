However, existing sequential and graph-based methods frequently neglect significant mobility variations across distinct contextual scenarios (e.g., tourists versus locals). This oversight results in suboptimal performance due to two fundamental limitations: the inability to capture scenario-specific features and the failure to resolve inherent inter-scenario conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multifaceted Scenario-Aware Hypergraph Learning method (MSAHG), a framework that adopts a scenario-splitting paradigm for next POI recommendation.\n  Our main contributions are:\n  (1) Construction of scenario-specific, multi-view disentangled sub-hypergraphs to capture distinct mobility patterns;\n  (2) A parameter-splitting mechanism to adaptively resolve conflicting optimization directions across scenarios while preserving generalization capability.\n  Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MSAHG consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, confirming its effectiveness in multi-scenario POI recommendation."}

Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution."}

However, most ABMs rely on handcrafted or parameterized agent rules that are not empirically grounded, thereby limiting their realism and validation against observed data. To address this gap, we constructed a large-scale, empirically grounded dataset from Reddit to support the development and evaluation of agent-based social simulations. The dataset includes 33 technology-focused, 14 climate-focused, and 7 COVID-related aggregated agents, encompassing around one million posts and comments. Using publicly available posts and comments, we define agent categories based on content and interaction patterns, derive inter-agent relationships from temporal commenting behaviors, and build a directed, weighted network that reflects empirically observed user connections. The resulting dataset enables researchers to calibrate and benchmark agent behavior, network structure, and information diffusion processes against real social dynamics. Our quantitative analysis reveals clear topic-dependent differences in how users interact. Climate discussions show dense, highly connected networks with sustained engagement, COVID-related interactions are sparse and mostly one-directional, and technology discussions are organized around a small number of central hubs. Manual qualitative analysis further shows that agent interactions follow realistic patterns of timing, similarity between users, and sentiment change."}

Optimization problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions aim to minimize F(x), which is encrypted/transformed/encrypted to F_k(x) as the output at the k-th iteration. A new derivative-free solver named DFOp, with its implementation, is proposed in this paper, which has a new updating formula for the quadratic model functions. The convergence of DFOp for solving problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions is given. Other analyses, including the new model updating formula and the analysis of the transformation's impact to model functions are presented. We propose two differentially private noise-adding mechanisms for privacy-preserving black-box optimization. Numerical results show that DFOp performs better than compared algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, DFOp is the first derivative-free solver that can solve black-box optimization problems with step-encryption and privacy-preserving black-box problems exactly, which also tries to answer the open question about the combination of derivative-free optimization and privacy."}

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows.

Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

To address this gap, we leveraged a large-scale dataset of ~26M posts and ~45M comments on the BlueSky platform, and conducted a quasi-experimental study, matching 81,345 Treated users exposed to News feeds with 83,711 Control users using stratified propensity score analysis. We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts. Our work extends theories of news effects beyond crisis-centric frameworks by demonstrating that routine consumption creates distinct psychological dynamics depending on engagement type, and bears implications for tools and interventions for mitigating the psychosocial costs of news consumption on social media."}

Meanwhile, machine learning inference workloads increasingly migrate to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms for their scalability and cost-efficiency [2], [3], [4]. However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency. We release an open-source security toolkit to enable practitioners to assess and harden their serverless AI deployments, advancing the field toward more resilient cloud-native machine learning systems."}

Using the timeline of the EU AI Act and an assumed compute doubling time of six months, we conduct a high precision simulation with 10001 time steps. The results show that an earlier intervention timing reduces the cumulative social burden by approximately sixty four percent, whereas improving enforcement efficiency reduces it by only about thirty percent. We further demonstrate analytically that advancing the start of intervention has structurally higher sensitivity, with roughly twice the relative effectiveness, compared to accelerating enforcement speed. These findings suggest that the core value of AI governance lies in proactive timeliness rather than reactive administrative efficiency."}

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance."}

Our results show that the strongest spillover was from \"live\" incidents to \"die at the scene\", where we estimate that 0.34 (0.09, 0.80) of \"die at the scene\" incidents are triggered by a prior event in which the offender survived the attack. This pathway also exhibits the longest estimated contagion timescale: approximately 20 days. In contrast, the reverse influence, that is, \"die at the scene\"$\\rightarrow$\"live\", is not statistically significant, with the lower bound of its 95% confidence interval nearly equal to zero. We also find that \"die at the scene\" events can only cause their own type, where 0.139 (0.01, 0.52) of such incidents are caused by previous \"die at the scene\" events, with the shortest contagion timescale of roughly 20 hours."}

This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains.

This study introduces the Signal Competition Mechanism, a unified framework validated by assessing behavioral correlations across 15 LLMs and performing latent-space probing on three representative open-source models. The analysis demonstrates that sycophancy and conformity originate from a convergent geometric manifold, hereafter termed the compliance subspace, which is characterized by high directional similarity in internal representations. Furthermore, the transition to compliance is shown to be a deterministic process governed by a linear boundary, where the Social Emotional Signal effectively suppresses the Information Calibration Signal. Crucially, we identify a \"Transparency-Truth Gap,\" revealing that while internal confidence provides an inertial barrier, it remains permeable and insufficient to guarantee immunity against intense social pressure. By formalizing the Integrated Epistemic Alignment Framework, this research provides a blueprint for transitioning from instructional adherence to robust epistemic integrity."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

Motivated by the observation that LLM embeddings exhibit distinct states, suggesting discrete semantic representations, we explore the application of these mathematical tools to analyze semantic relationships. We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics. While the interpretation warrants careful consideration, our results suggest that this approach offers a promising avenue for gaining deeper insights into LLMs and potentially informing new methods for mitigating hallucinations."}

Traditional rumor detection relied primarily on manual analysis. With the continuous advancement of technology, machine learning and deep learning approaches for rumor identification have gradually emerged and gained prominence. However, previous approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture both the sequential and the global structural relationships among topological nodes within a social network. To tackle this issue, we introduce a hybrid model for detecting rumors that integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Transformer architecture, aiming to leverage the complementary strengths of structural and semantic feature extraction. Positional encoding helps preserve the sequential order of these nodes within the propagation structure. The use of Multi-head attention mechanisms enables the model to capture features across diverse representational subspaces, thereby enhancing both the richness and depth of text comprehension. This integration allows the framework to concurrently identify the key propagation network of rumors, the textual content, the long-range dependencies, and the sequence among propagation nodes.

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models."}

Agre's Legacy", "comment": "13 pages", "summary": "This paper examines the intellectual legacy of Philip E. Agre by situating his work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy, and critical theory. It reconstructs Agre's proposal of a critical technical practice, according to which AI should be understood not merely as an engineering discipline but as a form of mathematized philosophy shaped by historically contingent metaphors, assumptions, and discourses. Drawing on Heideggerian phenomenology, especially the distinction between ready-to-hand and present-at-hand, Agre sought to reform AI by emphasizing interaction, embedding, indexicality, and deictic representation over traditional mentalist and representational models. The paper analyzes Agre's attempt to operationalize these ideas through computational implementations such as the Pengi system, highlighting both the philosophical ambition and the technical limitations of programming phenomenological concepts. While acknowledging Agre's success in exposing the hidden philosophical commitments of AI and enriching its conceptual vocabulary, the paper ultimately argues that his project encounters a fundamental impasse: the open and self-disclosing character of human existence articulated by Heidegger cannot be fully captured or programmed without reducing ontological phenomena to ontic mechanisms. Agre's enduring contribution therefore lies less in offering a viable Heideggerian AI than in compelling technical practice to become reflexive, historically conscious, and openly philosophical."}

We propose a training-time interpretability view that tracks token-level attributions across finetuning epochs. We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment."}

While prior work has shown that the platform's bridging-based algorithm effectively selects helpful notes at the time of display, little is known about how evaluations change after notes become visible. Using a large-scale dataset of 437,396 community notes and 35 million ratings from over 580,000 contributors, we examine the stability of helpful notes and the rating dynamics that follow their initial display. We find that 30.2% of displayed notes later lose their helpful status and disappear. Using interrupted time series models, we further show that note display triggers a sharp increase in rating volume and a significant shift in rating leaning, but these effects differ across rater groups. Contributors with viewpoints similar to note authors tend to increase supportive ratings, while dissimilar contributors increase negative ratings, producing systematic post-display polarization. Counterfactual analyses suggest that this post-display polarization, particularly from dissimilar raters, plays a substantial role in note disappearance.

Our measurements indicate that these timing variations stem from the micro-op cache placement and the jump's offset in the L1 instruction cache of modern processors. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent across multiple microarchitectures, including Skylake, Coffee Lake, and Kaby Lake, as well as various real-world implementations. We confirm the prevalence of this variability through extensive experiments on a large-scale set of popular binaries, including libraries from Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 10 Pro, and several open-source cryptographic libraries. We also show that one can easily avoid this timing variability by ensuring that macro-fusible instructions are 32-byte aligned - an approach initially suggested in 2019 by Intel in an overlooked short report. We quantify the performance impact of this approach across the cryptographic libraries, showing a speedup of 2.15% on average (and up to 10.54%) when avoiding the timing variability. As a by-product, we show that this variability can be exploited as a covert channel, achieving a maximum throughput of 16.14 Mbps."}

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers."}

This approach misses a different, and arguably more diagnostic, dimension of opinion change: whether deliberation reshuffles who agrees with whom, or simply moves everyone in parallel while preserving the pre-deliberation rank ordering. We introduce \\opinion mixing, measured by Kendall's rank correlation (τ) between pre- and post-deliberation responses, as a complement to variance-based polarization metrics. Across two large online deliberative polls spanning 32 countries (MCF-2022: n=6,342; MCF-2023: n=1,529), deliberation increases opinion mixing relative to survey-only controls: treatment groups exhibit lower rank correlation on (97%) and (93%) of opinion questions, respectively. Polarization measures based on variance tell a more heterogeneous story: controls consistently converge, while treated groups sometimes converge and sometimes diverge depending on the issue.\n  To probe mechanisms, we link transcripts and surveys in a third event (SOF: (n=617), 116 groups) and use LLM-assisted coding of 6,232 discussion statements. Expressed support in discussion statements strongly predicts subsequent group-level opinion shifts; this correlation is amplified by justification quality in the statements but not by argument novelty. To our knowledge, we are the first to observe how different notions of argument quality have different associations with the outcome of deliberation. This suggests that opinion change after deliberation is related to selective uptake of well-reasoned arguments, producing complex patterns of opinion reorganization that standard polarization metrics may miss."}

An exploratory framework", "comment": null, "summary": "The rise of Human-AI Collaborative Learning (HAICL) is shifting education toward dialogue-centric paradigms, creating an urgent need for new assessment methods. Evaluating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in this context presents new challenges, as the limitations of conventional approaches become more apparent. Questionnaires remain interrupted, while the utility of non-interrupted metrics like clickstream data is diminishing as more learning activity occurs within the dialogue. This study therefore investigates whether the student-AI dialogue can serve as a valid, non-interrupted data source for SRL assessment. We analyzed 421 dialogue logs from 98 university students interacting with a generative AI (GenAI) learning partner. Using large language model embeddings and clustering, we identified 22 dialogue patterns and quantified each student's interaction as a profile of alignment scores, which were analyzed against their Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ) scores. Findings revealed a significant positive association between proactive dialogue patterns (e.g., post-class knowledge integration) and overall SRL. Conversely, reactive patterns (e.g., foundational pre-class questions) were significantly and negatively associated with overall SRL and its sub-processes. A group comparison substantiated these results, with low-SRL students showing significantly higher alignment with reactive patterns than their high-SRL counterparts. This study proposed the Dialogue-Based Human-AI Self-Regulated Learning (DHASRL) framework, a practical methodology for embedding SRL assessment directly within the HAICL dialogue to enable real-time monitoring and scaffolding of student regulation."}

Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation.

The track uses the MixSub dataset \\cite{10172215}, which provides pairs of abstracts and corresponding author-written highlights.\n  In this inaugural edition of the track, 12 teams participated, exploring various approaches, including pre-trained language models, to generate highlights from this scientific dataset. All submissions were evaluated using established metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore to measure both alignment with author-written highlights and overall informativeness. Teams were ranked based on ROUGE-L scores. The findings suggest that automatically generated highlights can reduce reading effort, accelerate literature reviews, and enhance metadata for digital libraries and academic search platforms. SciHigh provides a dedicated benchmark for advancing methods aimed at concise and accurate highlight generation from scientific writing."}

Objective: This paper aims to consolidate existing research on technical lag, clarify definitions, explore its detection and quantification methods, examine underlying causes and consequences, review current management practices, and lay out a vision as an indicator of passively accumulated technical debt. Method: We conducted a Rapid Review with snowballing to select the appropriate peer-reviewed studies. We leveraged the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Springer as our primary source databases. Results: Technical lag accumulates passively, often unnoticed due to inadequate detection metrics and tools. It negatively impacts software quality through outdated dependencies, obsolete APIs, unsupported platforms, and aging infrastructure. Strategies to manage technical lag primarily involve automated dependency updates, continuous integration processes, and regular auditing. Conclusions: Enhancing and extending the current standardized metrics, detection methods, and empirical studies to use technical lag as an indication of accumulated latent debt can greatly improve the process of maintaining large codebases that are heavily dependent on external packages. We have identified the research gaps and outlined a future vision for researchers and practitioners to explore."}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

As an open ISA, RISC-V lowers the barriers to processor design and encourages widespread adoption, but also exposes processors to security risks such as functional bugs. Processor fuzzing is a powerful technique for automatically detecting these bugs. However, existing fuzzing methods suffer from two main limitations. First, their emphasis on redundant test case generation causes them to overlook cross-processor corner cases. Second, they rely too heavily on coverage guidance. Current coverage metrics are biased and inefficient, and become ineffective once coverage growth plateaus. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimFuzz, a fuzzing framework that constructs a high-quality seed corpus from historical bug-triggering inputs and employs similarity-guided, block-level mutation to efficiently explore the processor input space. By introducing instruction similarity, SimFuzz expands the input space around seeds while preserving control-flow structure, enabling deeper exploration without relying on coverage feedback. We evaluate SimFuzz on three widely used open-source RISC-V processors: Rocket, BOOM, and XiangShan, and discover 17 bugs in total, including 14 previously unknown issues, 7 of which have been assigned CVE identifiers. These bugs affect the decode and memory units, cause instruction and data errors, and can lead to kernel instability or system crashes. Experimental results show that SimFuzz achieves up to 73.22% multiplexer coverage on the high-quality seed corpus. Our findings highlight critical security bugs in mainstream RISC-V processors and offer actionable insights for improving functional verification."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes \"Bit-politeia\", an AI agent community on blockchain designed to construct a fair, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation system. In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a \"clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture\" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms. Agents engage through casual chat and deliberative interactions to evaluate research outputs and distribute a virtual currency as rewards. This incentive mechanism aims to achieve incentive compatibility through consensus-driven evaluation, while blockchain technology ensures immutable records of all transactions and reputation data. By leveraging AI for objective assessment and decentralized verification, Bit-politeia minimizes human bias and mitigates resource centralization issues found in traditional peer review. The proposed framework provides a novel pathway for optimizing scientific innovation through a fair and automated resource configuration process."}

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning. Thus, we suggest that auditors scope automated evaluation protocols strictly: delegate all deterministically verifiable logic to code, while reserving LLM judges for complex semantic evaluation."}

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment."}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime.

This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts.

Based on a formal model of LLM agent systems, we identify novel privilege escalation scenarios, particularly in multi-agent systems, including a variant akin to the classic confused deputy problem. To defend against both known and newly demonstrated privilege escalation, we propose SEAgent, a mandatory access control (MAC) framework built upon attribute-based access control (ABAC). SEAgent monitors agent-tool interactions via an information flow graph and enforces customizable security policies based on entity attributes. Our evaluations show that SEAgent effectively blocks various privilege escalation while maintaining a low false positive rate and negligible system overhead. This demonstrates its robustness and adaptability in securing LLM-based agent systems."}

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

While these tools may increase student productivity, they also make it more difficult for instructors to assess students' learning and effort. In this quasi-longitudinal study, we analyze five years of student source code submissions in a graduate-level cloud computing course, focusing on an assignment that remained unchanged and examining students' behavior during the period spanning five semesters before the release of ChatGPT and five semesters after.\n  Student coding behavior has changed significantly since Fall 2022. The length of their final submissions increased. Between consecutive submissions, average edit distances increased while average score improvement decreased, suggesting that both student productivity and learning have decreased after ChatGPT's release. Additionally, there are statistically significant correlations between these behavioral changes and their overall performance. Although we cannot definitively attribute them to LLM misuse, they are consistent with our hypothesis that some students are over-reliant on LLMs, which is negatively affecting their learning outcomes.

Thus, patients require lifelong insulin therapy, which has a side effect of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a critical state of decreased blood glucose levels (BGL) below 70 mg/dL and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs).

Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server.

This paper presents an evidence-grounded multi-agent planning support system for urban carbon governance built upon standard text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (without GraphRAG). We align the system with the typical planning workflow by decomposing tasks into four specialized agents: (i) evidence Q\\&A for fact checking and compliance queries, (ii) emission status assessment for diagnostic analysis, (iii) planning recommendation for generating multi-sector governance pathways, and (iv) report integration for producing planning-style deliverables.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

This paper presents a comprehensive survey and a conceptual overview of Hybrid IDS, which integrate signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to enhance attack detection capabilities. The survey examines recent research on Hybrid IDS, classifies existing models into functional categories, and discusses their advantages, limitations, and application domains, including financial systems, air traffic control, and social networks.

Sources from major academic and grey-literature repositories from the past decade were screened. The search identified 2,216 records; after deduplication and screening, 645 articles underwent eligibility assessment, and 122 were included for analysis. The corpus was organized along three thematic categories: technical solutions, policy/regulatory measures, and education/awareness strategies. Findings reveal that while technical interventions such as on-device processing, federated learning, and lightweight encryption significantly reduce data exposure, their adoption remains limited. Policy frameworks, including the EU's GDPR, the UK Age-Appropriate Design Code, and Canada's PIPEDA, provide important baselines but are hindered by gaps in enforcement and age-appropriate design obligations, while educational initiatives are rarely integrated systematically into curricula. Overall, the corpus skews toward technical solutions (67%) relative to policy (21%) and education (12%), indicating an implementation gap outside the technical domain. To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-stakeholder model in which policymakers, manufacturers, and educators co-develop inclusive, transparent, and context-sensitive privacy ecosystems.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off."}

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling.

Adapting quantitative risk measures from financial mathematics, we define Privacy Loss at Risk (P-VaR) to characterize worst-case privacy outcomes under realistic cohort dynamics and adversary assumptions.\n  We validate our framework through system-level analysis and simulation experiments, demonstrating how privacy-utility tradeoffs can be operationalized for digital health platforms.

Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics."}

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves Rényi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing."}

However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \\texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint."}

Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.\n  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.\n  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs."}

Compared to other social and technological systems we rely on daily such as consumer products, corporate financial statements, and food supply chains, AI is subject to less rigorous third-party scrutiny along several dimensions. Ambiguity about whether AI systems are trustworthy can discourage deployment in some contexts where the technology could be beneficial, and make it more likely when it's dangerous. Public transparency alone cannot close this gap: many safety- and security-relevant details are legitimately confidential and require expert interpretation.

This paper presents LAMPS, a multi-agent system that employs collaborative LLMs to detect malicious PyPI packages. The system consists of four role-specific agents for package retrieval, file extraction, classification, and verdict aggregation, coordinated through the CrewAI framework. A prototype combines a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for classification with LLaMA-3 agents for contextual reasoning. LAMPS has been evaluated on two complementary datasets: D1, a balanced collection of 6,000 setup.py files, and D2, a realistic multi-file dataset with 1,296 files and natural class imbalance. On D1, LAMPS achieves 97.7% accuracy, surpassing MPHunter--one of the state-of-the-art approaches. On D2, it reaches 99.5% accuracy and 99.5% balanced accuracy, outperforming RAG-based approaches and fine-tuned single-agent baselines.

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs."}

This shift risks allowing private technology providers to define sovereignty on their own terms. By analyzing the history of sovereignty and parallels in global oil production, this paper aims to open avenues to interrogate the implications of this value's commercialization. The contributions of this paper lie in a disentangling of the facets of sovereignty being appealed to through the AI stack and a case for how analogizing oil and AI can be generative in thinking through what is achieved and what can be achieved through the commodification of AI sovereignty."}

Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe. Particularly, despite code verification exhibiting positive training- and inference-time scaling, on-policy learning stands out as the key component at small verifier sizes, and thinking-based training emerges as the most important component at larger scales."}

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces."}

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.\n  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal).

Users are incessantly asked to \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" of data collection, forced to make defensive decisions whose consequences are increasingly difficult to predict. Viewed through the Johari Window, a psychological framework of self-awareness based on what is known and unknown to self and others, current policies require users to manage the Open Self and shield the Hidden Self through notice and consent. However, as organizations increasingly use AI to make inferences, the rapid expansion of Blind Self, attributes known to algorithms but unknown to the user, emerges as a critical challenge. We illustrate how current regulations fall short because they focus on data collection rather than inference and leave this blind spot unguarded. Building on the theory of Contextual Integrity, we propose a paradigm shift from defensive privacy management to proactive privacy advocacy. We argue for the necessity of personal advocacy agents capable of operationalizing social norms to harness the power of AI inference. By illuminating the hidden inferences that users can strategically leverage or suppress, these agents not only restrain the growth of Blind Self but also mine it for value. By transforming the Unknown Self into a personal asset for users, we can foster a flow of personal information that is equitable, transparent, and individually beneficial in the age of AI."}

Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback.

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.

In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats."}

Furthermore, there is no common framework for describing different types and levels of evaluator access. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of access methods for dangerous capability evaluations. We disentangle three aspects of access: model access, model information, and evaluation timeframe. For each aspect, we review benefits and risks, including how expanding access can reduce false negatives and improve stakeholder trust, but can also increase security and capacity challenges. We argue that these limitations can likely be mitigated through technical means and safeguards used in other industries. Based on the taxonomy, we propose three descriptive access levels: AL1 (black-box model access and minimal information), AL2 (grey-box model access and substantial information), and AL3 (white-box model access and comprehensive information), to support clearer communication between evaluators, frontier AI companies, and policymakers. We believe these levels correspond to the different standards for appropriate access defined in the EU Code of Practice, though these standards may change over time."}

However, existing approaches often suffer from low repair success rates or poor understandability of the generated patches. In this study, we construct a framework in which a large language model (LLM) generates code repairs along with a natural language explanation of the applied repairs. To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations. Our findings point toward new directions for developing APR techniques for quantum programs that enhance both reliability and explainability."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks."}

This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations.

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces.

While prior work has identified shortcomings of platform-provided data access mechanisms, existing research has not quantitatively assessed data quality and completeness in Research APIs across platforms, nor systematically mapped how current access provisions fall short. This paper presents a systematic audit of research access modalities by comparing data obtained through platform Research APIs with data collected about the same platforms' user-visible public information environment (PIE). Focusing on two major platform APIs, the TikTok Research API and the Meta Content Library, we reconstruct full information feeds for two controlled sockpuppet accounts during two election periods and benchmark these against the data retrievable for the same posts through the corresponding Research APIs. Our findings show systematic data loss through three classes of platform-imposed mechanisms: scope narrowing, metadata stripping, and operational restrictions. Together, these mechanisms implement overlapping filters that exclude large portions of the platform PIE (up to approximately 50 percent), strip essential contextual metadata (up to approximately 83 percent), and impose severe technical constraints for researchers (down to approximately 1000 requests per day). Viewed through a data quality lens, these filters primarily undermine completeness, resulting in a structurally biased representation of platform activity. We conclude that, in their current form, the Meta and TikTok Research APIs fall short of supporting meaningful, independent auditing of systemic risks as envisioned under the DSA."}

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively."}

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

While predictive, these tools typically treat risk as a static, individual attribute, which overlooks how risk evolves over time and how treatment decisions shape outcomes through social interactions. In this paper, we develop a new framework that models reoffending risk as a human-system interaction, linking individual behavior with system-level dynamics and endogenous community feedback. Using an agent-based simulation calibrated to U.S. probation data, we evaluate treatment allocation policies under different capacity constraints and incarceration settings. Our results show that no single prioritization policy dominates. Instead, policy effectiveness depends on temporal windows and system parameters: prioritizing low-risk individuals performs better when long-term trajectories matter, while prioritizing high-risk individuals becomes more effective in the short term or when incarceration leads to shorter monitoring periods. These findings highlight the need to evaluate risk-based decision systems as sociotechnical systems with long-term accountability, rather than as isolated predictive tools."}

To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software."}

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct."}

We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space. The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch."}

To address this gap, we propose VR ProfiLens, a framework to study user profiling based on VR sensor data and the resulting privacy risks across consumer VR apps. To systematically study this problem, we first develop a taxonomy rooted in the CCPA definition of personal information and expand it by sensor, app, and threat contexts to identify user attributes at risk. Then, we conduct a user study in which we collect VR sensor data from four sensor groups from real users interacting with 10 popular consumer VR apps, followed by a survey. We design and apply an analysis pipeline to demonstrate the feasibility of inferring user attributes using these data. Our results show that sensitive personal information can be inferred with moderately high to high risk (up to 90% F1 score) from abstracted sensor data. Through feature analysis, we further identify correlations among app groups and sensor groups in inferring user attributes. Our findings highlight risks to users, including privacy loss, tracking, targeted advertising, and safety threats.

While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms. Situated within an international order shaped more by AI arms race dynamics than cooperative governance, the paper outlines the contours of a global AI accountability and compensation architecture, emphasizing the tension between geopolitical rivalry and the collective action required to govern transboundary AI risks effectively."}

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance."}

Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning."}

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

IPV survivors who rely on therapeutic devices encounter a qualitatively different threat environment from the external, technically sophisticated adversaries typically modeled in MedTech cybersecurity research. We address this gap through two complementary methods: (1) the development of hazard-integrated threat models that fuse Cyber physical system security modeling with tech-abuse frameworks, and (2) an immersive simulation with practitioners, deploying a live version of our model, identifying gaps in digital forensic practice.\n  Our hazard-integrated CIA threat models map exploits to acute and chronic biological effects, uncovering (i) Integrity attack pathways that facilitate \"Medical gaslighting\" and \"Munchausen-by-IoMT\", (ii) Availability attacks that create life-critical and sub-acute harms (glycaemic emergencies, blindness, mood destabilization), and (iii) Confidentiality threats arising from MedTech advertisements (geolocation tracking from BLE broadcasts). Our simulation demonstrates that these attack surfaces are unlikely to be detected in practice: participants overlooked MedTech, misclassified reproductive and assistive technologies, and lacked awareness of BLE broadcast artifacts.

Current benchmarks predominantly focus on public safety and Western cultural norms, leaving a critical gap in evaluating the niche, high-risk domain of medical ethics within the Chinese context. Objective: To establish a specialized jailbreak evaluation framework for Chinese medical ethics and to systematically assess the defensive resilience and ethical alignment of seven prominent LLMs when subjected to sophisticated adversarial simulations. Methodology: We evaluated seven prominent models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning, DeepSeek-R1) using a \"role-playing + scenario simulation + multi-turn dialogue\" vector within the DeepInception framework. The testing focused on eight high-risk themes, including commercial surrogacy and organ trading, utilizing a hierarchical scoring matrix to quantify the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and ASR Gain. Results: A systemic collapse of defenses was observed, whereas models demonstrated high baseline compliance, the jailbreak ASR reached 82.1%, representing an ASR Gain of over 80 percentage points. Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning emerged as the most robust model, while five models including Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-4.1 exhibited near-total failure with ASRs between 96% and 100%. Conclusions: Current LLMs are highly vulnerable to contextual manipulation in medical ethics, often prioritizing \"helpfulness\" over safety constraints. To enhance security, we recommend a transition from outcome to process supervision, the implementation of multi-factor identity verification, and the establishment of cross-model \"joint defense\" mechanisms."}

Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties.

Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties.

Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation.

Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference.

In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model.

However, the robustness of existing methods remains a critical challenge when confronting novel or evolving tools. Existing trajectory-centric paradigms primarily rely on memorizing static solution paths during training, which limits the ability of LLMs to generalize tool usage to newly introduced or previously unseen tools. In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolMaster significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of generalization and robustness across unseen or unfamiliar tools.

In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts."}

By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines. Overall, MixFlow offers a simple yet powerful approach for achieving robust, generalizable, and controllable generative modeling across heterogeneous domains."}

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

First, we conduct a systematic literature review to examine how Docker is framed in scientific discourse on reproducibility and to identify documented best practices for writing Dockerfiles enabling reproducible image building. Then, we perform a large-scale empirical study of 5298 Docker builds collected from GitHub workflows. By rebuilding these images and comparing the results with their historical counterparts, we assess the real reproducibility of Docker images and evaluate the effectiveness of the best practices identified in the literature."}

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

Building on this, we propose Dual-task Universal Adversarial Perturbation (DUAP). Specifically, DUAP employs a targeted surrogate objective to effectively disrupt ASR transcription and introduces a Dynamic Normalized Ensemble (DNE) strategy to enhance transferability across diverse SR models. Furthermore, we incorporate psychoacoustic masking to ensure perturbation imperceptibility. Extensive evaluations across five ASR and six SR models demonstrate that DUAP achieves high simultaneous attack success rates and superior imperceptibility, significantly outperforming existing single-task baselines."}

However, annotating conventional programs with the formal specification and verification constructs (preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, auxiliary predicates and functions and proof helpers) required to prove their correctness still demands significant manual effort and expertise. This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions. We also compare generated and manual solutions and present an extension for Visual Studio Code to incorporate automatic generation into the IDE, with encouraging usability feedback."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis.

We introduce the concept of influence, confirmed by philosophical and chronological analysis, to examine the underlying relationship between the theories and the Act. As a proxy measure of this influence, we propose using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) to quantify the degree of alignment between the theories (influencers) and the Act (influencee). To capture intentional and operational ethical consistency, the Act was divided into two parts: the preamble and the statutory provisions. The textual descriptions of the theories were manually preprocessed to reduce semantic overlap and ensure a distinct representation of each theory. A heterogeneous embedding-level ensemble approach was employed, utilizing five modified Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, built on the Transformer architecture, to compute STS scores. These scores represent the semantic alignment between various theories of ethics and each of the two components of the EU AI Act. The theories were evaluated by using voting and averaging, with findings indicating that deontological ethics has the most significant overall influence."}

The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple public and self-built datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios."}

Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction."}

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question. To this end, we propose a novel local search framework based on a transformation to a dominating matching set problem, achieving the best possible approximation ratio of 2. The experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines in solution quality."}

However, less is known about how students' prior help history (whether they were helped earlier) and their engagement states (e.g., idle, struggle) shape teachers' decisions, and whether observed learning benefits associated with teacher help extend beyond the current class session. To address these questions, we first conducted interviews with nine K-12 mathematics teachers to identify candidate decision factors for teacher help. We then analyzed 1.4 million student-system interactions from 339 students across 14 classes in the MATHia intelligent tutoring system by linking teacher-logged help events with fine-grained engagement states. Mixed-effects models show that students who received help earlier were more likely to receive additional help later, even after accounting for current engagement state. Cross-lagged panel analyses further show that teacher help recurred across sessions, whereas idle behavior did not receive sustained attention over time. Finally, help coincided with immediate learning within sessions, but did not predict skill acquisition in later sessions, as estimated by additive factor modeling.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new benchmark designed for software package build repair across diverse architectures and languages. Comprising 268 real-world software package build failures, the benchmark provides a standardized evaluation pipeline. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmark, and the results show that cross-ISA software package repair remains difficult and requires further advances. By systematically exposing this challenge, the benchmark establishes a foundation for advancing future methods aimed at improving software portability and bridging architectural gaps."}

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_ρ$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $ρ$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit."}

By examining the execution model of obfuscated code, we define and detect the key elements required for deobfuscation-namely the dispatch routine, handler blocks, and the VM region-using LLVM IR.

However, there is a lack of transparency in the goals of such projects, as well as a missing evaluation of their actual impacts on society and the planet. We close this gap by proposing public interest and sustainability as a regulatory dual-concept, together creating the necessary framework for a just and sustainable development that can be operationalized and utilized for the assessment of AI systems. Based on this framework, and building on existing work in auditing, we introduce the Impact-AI-method, a qualitative audit method to evaluate concrete AI projects with respect to public interest and sustainability. The interview-based method captures a project's governance structure, its theory of change, AI model and data characteristics, and social, environmental, and economic impacts. We also propose a catalog of assessment criteria to rate the outcome of the audit as well as to create an accessible output that can be debated broadly by civil society. The Impact-AI-method, developed in a transdisciplinary research setting together with NGOs and a multi-stakeholder research council, is intended as a reusable blueprint that both informs public debate about AI 'for good' claims and supports the creation of transparency of AI systems that purport to contribute to a just and sustainable development."}

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures.

This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations."}

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable."}

Far from passive spectators, these actors co-produce propaganda, blending state-aligned messages with their own extremist framings. In Russia, such groups are central because they articulate the ideological foundations of the war against Ukraine and reflect the regime's gradual drift toward ultranationalist rhetoric. Drawing on a dataset of 200,000 images from expert-selected far-right Telegram channels, the study employs computer vision and unsupervised clustering to identify memes featuring Russian (Putin, Shoigu) and foreign politicians (Zelensky, Biden, Trump) and to reveal recurrent visual patterns in their representation. By leveraging the large-scale and temporal depth of this dataset, the analysis uncovers differential patterns of legitimation and delegitimation across actors and over time. These insights are not attainable in smaller-scale studies. Preliminary findings show that far-right memes function as instruments of propaganda co-production. These communities do not simply echo official messages but generate bottom-up narratives of legitimation and delegitimation that align with state ideology. By framing leaders as heroic and opponents as corrupt or weak, far-right actors act as informal co-creators of authoritarian legitimacy within Russia's informational autocracy."}

In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs."}

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

A key use case is detecting event-based signatures, which represent attacks spanning multiple events and can only be understood once the relevant events are identified and linked.

Researchers rely on these datasets to develop and test techniques for automatically identifying signatures. However, because real datasets are security-sensitive and rarely shared, it becomes difficult to perform meaningful comparative evaluation between different approaches. This work addresses this evaluation limitation by offering a systematic method for generating event logs with known ground truth, enabling reproducible and comparable research. We present a novel parametrised generation technique capable of producing synthetic event datasets that contain event-based signatures for discovery. To demonstrate the capabilities of the technique, we provide a benchmark in signature detection.

To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets.

Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the \"availability of data and labels.\" This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. Guided by this unified structure, the methodological landscape is dissected to reveal critical challenges such as fidelity gaps and frontiers including co-evolutionary ecosystems. Ultimately, by systematizing this fragmented field, data generation is positioned as the central engine for next-generation DI."}

We propose a hybrid quantum-classical regression framework designed to mitigate these bottlenecks. Our model prepends a lightweight classical embedding that acts as a learnable geometric preconditioner, reshaping the input representation to better condition a downstream variational quantum circuit. Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression."}

Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging.

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

In this work, we derive and evaluate development-specific prompt optimization guidelines. First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines. Our results lead to implications not only for practitioners and educators, but also for those aimed at creating better LLM-aided software development tools."}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

In this work, we propose PrivFly, a privacy-preserving IDS framework that integrates self-supervised representation learning and differential privacy (DP) to enhance detection performance in imbalanced IoFT network traffic. We propose a masked feature reconstruction module for self-supervised pretraining, improving feature representations and boosting rare-class detection. Differential privacy is applied during training to protect sensitive information without significantly compromising model performance. In addition, we conduct a SHapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based analysis to evaluate the impact of DP on feature importance and model behavior.

We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts. Our work extends theories of news effects beyond crisis-centric frameworks by demonstrating that routine consumption creates distinct psychological dynamics depending on engagement type, and bears implications for tools and interventions for mitigating the psychosocial costs of news consumption on social media."}

To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity.

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool. Our findings show that GPT-4o generally produces behavior-preserving refactorings that reduce code smells and improve quality metrics, albeit at the cost of decreased readability.

To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods. We release KOCO-BENCH, evaluation code, and baselines to advance further research at https://github.com/jiangxxxue/KOCO-bench."}

An Evaluation on Perspective Taking and Knowledge State Estimation", "comment": "23 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Cognitive anthropology suggests that the distinction of human intelligence lies in the ability to infer other individuals' knowledge states and understand their intentions. In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in the area of knowledge state tracking and estimation. We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans. We argue future LLM research should place more weight on the abilities of knowledge estimation and intention understanding."}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft \"adversarial news\" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses. We notified trading platform owners of this security issue."}

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships. As eIDAS wallets become mandatory across EU member states, the proposed architecture provides a pathway for integrating European digital trust infrastructure into blockchain-based systems, enabling institutional DeFi participation, real-world asset tokenization, and agentic commerce within a trusted, regulatory-compliant framework."}

The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of \"who does what\" and \"how much it matters,\" while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not \"force\" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most. We evaluate SEER on PyDesignNet (1,832 files, 35,000 sequences, 23 GoF patterns) and observe consistent gains over our previous system: macro-F1 increases from 92.47% to 93.20% and accuracy from 92.52% to 93.98%, with macro-precision 93.98% and macro-recall 92.52%. Beyond aggregate metrics, SEER reduces false positives by nearly 20%, a decisive improvement that strengthens its robustness and practical reliability. Moreover, SEER yields interpretable, symbol-level attributions aligned with canonical roles, exhibits robustness under small graph perturbations, and shows stable calibration."}

Our evaluation encompassing three sequential tasks for complete proving: Extraction, Simplification, and Explanation, as well as an additional task of assessing Logic Completeness of the premise. Through extensive experiments on widely used reasoning LLMs, we achieve important findings including: (1) Some models achieve overall strong results but remain limited on complex cases; (2) Logical complexity, rather than representation format (formal logic language versus natural language), is the dominant factor shaping LLM performance; and (3) Noise and incompleteness in input data substantially diminish LLMs' performance.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks."}

Our framework requires no runtime execution and analyzes PTX code, a low-level instruction set for CUDA-enabled GPUs. It is validated across a diverse set of GPUs and kernels, including multi-head attention, convolution, and matrix multiplication. FlipFlop achieves 83% accuracy in identifying locally optimal energy-efficient configurations, while also minimizing developer effort by reducing the optimization search space by 93.4%. For multi-head attention kernels, it yields up to 79% energy savings and 106% throughput gains relative to NVIDIA's occupancy heuristic.

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development."}

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

We present a SAT-based function-recovery attack that reconstructs hidden gate operations from a circuit's public topology. To enable recovery on larger and more complex circuits, we develop an incremental SAT-solving framework combined with a set of composable, topology-preserving simplification theorems. These techniques jointly reduce the SAT instance size and progressively constrain the search space across repeated solving iterations.\n  We evaluate our attack on ISCAS benchmarks, representative secure computation circuits, and fault-tolerant sensor fusion circuits under a fixed 24-hour recovery budget. Compared to baseline approaches, our optimized attack achieves up to a 159-fold speedup in recovery time without increasing the number of oracle queries.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy.

However, many OSS projects face operational risks due to informal or centralized governance. This paper presents a practical case study of data.table, a high-performance R package widely adopted in production analytics pipelines, which underwent a community-led governance reform to address scalability and sustainability concerns. Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data. Our results show that following the reform, the project experienced a 200% increase in new contributor recruitment, a drop in pull request resolution time from over 700 days to under a week, and a 3x increase in contributor retention. Community sentiment improved around transparency, onboarding, and project momentum, though concerns around fairness and conflict resolution remain. This case study provides practical guidance for maintainers, companies, and foundations seeking to enhance OSS governance."}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

We present a longitudinal causal study of agent adoption in open-source repositories using staggered difference-in-differences with matched controls. Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput benefits. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising roughly 18% and 35%, indicating sustained agent-induced complexity debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties.

To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.\n  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures. (3) Lifecycle Escalation: Barriers escalate from intrinsic configuration struggles during fine-tuning to compounded environmental incompatibilities during inference.

EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Belis0811/EMoE."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query. We implement a prototype tool and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness on two widely-studied systems."}

This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making. Another contribution of this work is the release of the first-ever AIL HM dataset of SPS. This dataset contains four sub-datasets, involving 4 types of AIL HM sub-tasks, 17 types of faults, and over 700,000 timestamps."}

We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows. Empirically, TDA produces $>99\\%$ exact zeros and eliminates attention sinks while maintaining competitive performance on standard and long-context benchmarks."}

Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation."}

Within this framework an oriented masking mechanism clarifies roles and a comparative data construction strategy improves the model's sensitivity to culpability distinctions between principals and accomplices. Predicted guilt labels are further incorporated into a regression model through broadcasting, consolidating crime descriptions and court views.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks."}

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance.

The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model. We evaluate our approach on multi-location model changes that have actually been performed by developers in real-world projects. NextFocus achieves promising results for multi-location model completion, even when changes are heavily spread across the model.

In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach.

VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities. Together, these agents produce structured analyses that enrich the original issue reports, enabling more accurate vulnerability localization and patch generation.\n  Evaluations on the SEC-bench benchmark show that VulnResolver resolves 75% of issues on SEC-bench Lite, achieving the best resolution performance.

We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models."}

This study addresses a critical literature gap by comparatively testing three conditional volatility models the EWMA/IGARCH baseline, an IGARCH model augmented with explicit mean reversion (IGARCH + MR), and a modified EGARCH-style asymmetric shock model within a correlated Monte Carlo VaR framework. Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce RepoGenesis, the first multilingual benchmark for repository-level end-to-end web microservice generation, comprising 106 repositories (60 Python, 46 Java) across 18 domains and 11 frameworks, with 1,258 API endpoints and 2,335 test cases verified through a \"review-rebuttal\" quality assurance process.

Results reveal that despite high AC (up to 73.91%) and DSR (up to 100%), the best-performing system achieves only 23.67% Pass@1 on Python and 21.45% on Java, exposing deficiencies in architectural coherence, dependency management, and cross-file consistency. Notably, GenesisAgent-8B, fine-tuned on RepoGenesis (train), achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 mini, demonstrating the quality of RepoGenesis for advancing microservice generation.

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data.

The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives. This design produces representations that are temporally coherent and clinically grounded. Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data.

Given high model training costs and user experience requirements, balancing model privacy and low runtime overhead is critical. TEEs offer a viable defense, and prior work has proposed heterogeneous GPU-TEE inference frameworks via parameter obfuscation to balance efficiency and confidentiality. However, recent studies find partial obfuscation defenses ineffective, while robust schemes cause unacceptable latency. To resolve these issues, we propose ConvShatter, a novel obfuscation scheme that achieves low latency and high accuracy while preserving model confidentiality and integrity. It leverages convolution linearity to decompose kernels into critical and common ones, inject confounding decoys, and permute channel/kernel orders. Pre-deployment, it performs kernel decomposition, decoy injection and order obfuscation, storing minimal recovery parameters securely in the TEE. During inference, the TEE reconstructs outputs of obfuscated convolutional layers. Extensive experiments show ConvShatter substantially reduces latency overhead with strong security guarantees; versus comparable schemes, it cuts overhead by 16% relative to GroupCover while maintaining accuracy on par with the original model."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection.

Existing RRWEI schemes often exhibit limited robustness against noise, lossy compression, and cropping attacks due to insufficient redundancy in the encrypted domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel RRWEI framework that couples dual most significant bit-plane (dual-MSBs) embedding with spatial redundancy and error-correcting coding. By compressing prediction-error bit-planes, sufficient embedding space and auxiliary information for lossless reconstruction are reserved. The dual-MSBs are further reorganized using a spiral embedding strategy to distribute multiple redundant watermark copies across spatially dispersed regions, enhancing robustness against both noise and spatial loss.Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms under evaluated settings robustness against Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and diverse cropping attacks, while maintaining perfect reversibility and high embedding capacity.

We examine how and where maintainers provide this information, assess its validity, and explore coverage across individual libraries and their dependency chains.

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent.

This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design.

To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability."}

SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models.

Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process. Developers primarily implement text-focused features while struggling with API limitations and organizational constraints. Through systematic cross-platform comparison, we identify novel platform-specific barriers and demonstrate how accessibility practices differ across developer experience levels.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource.

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships. As eIDAS wallets become mandatory across EU member states, the proposed architecture provides a pathway for integrating European digital trust infrastructure into blockchain-based systems, enabling institutional DeFi participation, real-world asset tokenization, and agentic commerce within a trusted, regulatory-compliant framework."}

However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems."}

Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation."}

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models."}

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

As a result, processes launched remotely, locally, or by background services are often treated equivalently once privileges are obtained, complicating security reasoning and enabling post-compromise abuse of sensitive system interfaces. We introduce origin-aware mandatory access control (OAMAC), a kernel-level enforcement model that treats execution origin -- such as physical user presence, remote access, or service execution -- as a first-class security attribute. OAMAC mediates access to security-critical subsystems based on execution provenance rather than identity alone, enabling centralized governance over multiple attack surfaces while significantly reducing policy complexity. We present a deployable prototype implemented entirely using the Linux eBPF LSM framework, requiring no kernel modifications. OAMAC classifies execution origin using kernel-visible metadata, propagates origin across process creation, and enforces origin-aware policies on both sensitive filesystem interfaces and the kernel BPF control plane. Policies are maintained in kernel-resident eBPF maps and can be reconfigured at runtime via a minimal userspace tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that OAMAC effectively restricts common post-compromise actions available to remote attackers while preserving normal local administration and system stability. We argue that execution origin represents a missing abstraction in contemporary operating system security models, and that elevating it to a first-class concept enables practical attack surface reduction without requiring subsystem-specific expertise or heavyweight security frameworks."}

Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions."}

In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time.

Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data.

However, due to the fact that existing tools typically rely on agents installed on target systems, they leave suspicious traces that make it easy to distinguish their activities from those of real human attackers. Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement.

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials."}

CPFA learns head-wise prior-strength coefficients $\\{λ_h\\}$ that softly regularize attention toward the prior while allowing data-driven deviations when nonlinear patterns appear to be present in the data. Beyond imputation, SNI aggregates attention maps into a directed feature-dependency matrix that summarizes which variables the imputer relied on, without requiring post-hoc explainers.

Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results.

By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks.

To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space.

We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system.

Analyzing 25,000+ chain-of-thought trajectories across four domains (Law, Science, Code, Math) and two scales (8B, 70B parameters), we discover that neural scaling laws trigger domain-specific phase transitions rather than uniform capability gains. Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics.

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting."}

However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code.

The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models.

A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective.

Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare."}

While the most common decision tree learning algorithms treat data as a batch, numerous algorithms have been proposed to construct decision trees from a data stream. A standard training strategy involves augmenting the current tree by changing a leaf node into a split. Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + α)$ approximation in amortized $O(α^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$. In our experiments we find almost-optimal splits efficiently, faster than the baseline, overperforming the theoretical approximation guarantees."}

We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench.

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montréal Area (Québec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades."}

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential."}

Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq λ_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$.

This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features.

To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains. Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization. Experimental results show that MTA significantly outperforms baseline methods on unseen tools, demonstrating its promise for building flexible and scalable systems that require dynamic tool coordination."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can assess the consistency of small subsets of facts, their judgments are noisy, and pairwise checks are insufficient to guarantee global coherence. We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets. Our approach has low-degree polynomial query complexity. Experiments with both synthetic and real LLM oracles show that our method efficiently detects and localizes inconsistencies, offering a scalable framework for linguistic consistency verification with LLM-based evaluators."}

DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work."}

The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety."}

Theoretically, we show that susceptibilities decompose as a sum over modes of the data distribution, explaining why tokens that follow their contexts \"for similar reasons\" cluster together in susceptibility space. Empirically, we apply this methodology to Pythia-14M, developing a conductance-based clustering algorithm that identifies 510 interpretable clusters ranging from grammatical patterns to code structure to mathematical notation. Comparing to sparse autoencoders, 50% of our clusters match SAE features, validating that both methods recover similar structure."}

In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance. This gap suggests that current LLMs still struggle to maintain and change mental-state representations across long, linked interactions."}

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

Dissecting Probabilistic Confidence in Best-of-N Selection", "comment": "15 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning.

The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics.

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments."}

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings."}

While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden). Importantly PREFAB improves annotator confidence without degrading annotation quality."}

Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs.

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability."}

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs."}

However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment."}

Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods."}

Highlights help readers grasp essential ideas quickly and are often easier to read and understand than longer paragraphs, especially on mobile devices. The track uses the MixSub dataset \\cite{10172215}, which provides pairs of abstracts and corresponding author-written highlights.\n  In this inaugural edition of the track, 12 teams participated, exploring various approaches, including pre-trained language models, to generate highlights from this scientific dataset. All submissions were evaluated using established metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore to measure both alignment with author-written highlights and overall informativeness. Teams were ranked based on ROUGE-L scores. The findings suggest that automatically generated highlights can reduce reading effort, accelerate literature reviews, and enhance metadata for digital libraries and academic search platforms.

While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a \"clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture\" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms.

In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

The corpus was organized along three thematic categories: technical solutions, policy/regulatory measures, and education/awareness strategies. Findings reveal that while technical interventions such as on-device processing, federated learning, and lightweight encryption significantly reduce data exposure, their adoption remains limited. Policy frameworks, including the EU's GDPR, the UK Age-Appropriate Design Code, and Canada's PIPEDA, provide important baselines but are hindered by gaps in enforcement and age-appropriate design obligations, while educational initiatives are rarely integrated systematically into curricula. Overall, the corpus skews toward technical solutions (67%) relative to policy (21%) and education (12%), indicating an implementation gap outside the technical domain.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves Rényi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing."}

However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.\n  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance."}

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse.

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.

However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics.

To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window.

We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning.

To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage.

We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains.

Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication.

However, the computational cost of verifying large-scale models remains a significant barrier to adoption. This paper investigates the impact of pruning on formal local robustness certificates with different ratios. Using the state-of-the-art $α,β$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets. Our findings demonstrate a non-linear relationship: light pruning (40%) in MNIST and heavy pruning (70%-90%) in JPL improve verifiability, allowing models to outperform unpruned baselines in proven $L_\\infty$ robustness properties. This suggests that reduced connectivity simplifies the search space for formal solvers and that the optimal pruning ratio varies significantly between datasets. This research highlights the complex nature of model compression, offering critical insights into selecting the optimal pruning ratio for deploying efficient, yet formally verified, DNNs in high-stakes environments where reliability is non-negotiable."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization.

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \\pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \\pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines."}

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off."}

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs.

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties.

In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics."}

State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity."}

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance."}

To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution.

These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs."}

Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications.

By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains.

Although strong epidemiological evidence links oral health outcomes to socio-economic and demographic determinants, most artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dentistry rely on image-based diagnosis and black-box prediction models, limiting transparency and ethical applicability in pediatric populations.\n  Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning framework for pediatric dental risk stratification that prioritizes interpretability, calibration, and ethical deployment over maximal predictive accuracy.\n  Methods: A supervised machine learning model was trained using population-level pediatric data including age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.\n  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels. SHAP analysis identified age and income-to-poverty ratio as the strongest contributors to predicted risk, followed by race/ethnicity and gender.\n  Conclusion: Explainable machine learning enables transparent, prevention-oriented pediatric dental risk stratification and supports population screening and equitable resource allocation rather than diagnostic decision-making."}

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

In this work, we argue that this diversity obscures a simpler underlying structure. At a fundamental level, alignment objectives involve two independent design choices: (i) how training signals are sampled and weighted, and (ii) how deviations from a reference policy are geometrically penalized. Existing methods typically entangle these choices through a single divergence, most commonly the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n  We show that this entanglement is not merely a modeling convenience but a source of systematic instability. When the same divergence simultaneously determines sample weighting and optimization curvature, adjusting one aspect, such as exploration strength, inevitably alters the other, such as gradient geometry. This coupling is particularly problematic in preference-based reinforcement learning, where advantage signals are unbounded and high-confidence regimes are common.\n  We propose a simple but structural remedy by formulating alignment as an orthogonal mirror descent problem, in which sampling geometry enters only as a linear driving force, while optimization geometry is determined independently by a mirror map. This perspective leads to a new alignment objective called Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), obtained by choosing a Euclidean mirror map in likelihood ratio space. The resulting objective admits a closed-form solution, linear and non-saturating gradient dynamics, and a well-conditioned trust region, while remaining fully compatible with standard large language model training pipelines."}

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies.

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered."}

To regain global contextual understanding while preserving the advantages of the semi-autoregressive paradigm, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a 'draft-then-refine' framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilize snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using only 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models."}

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments."}

With low-rank approximation, FIPA remains communication- and computation-efficient. Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of FIPA for federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware.

While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms.

We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data).

SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction. Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting.

In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance.

We propose EEG-Titans, a dualbranch architecture that incorporates a modern neural memory mechanism for long-context modeling. The model combines sliding-window attention to capture short-term anomalies with a recurrent memory pathway that summarizes slower, progressive trends over time. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, evaluated under a chronological holdout protocol, EEG-Titans achieves 99.46% average segment-level sensitivity across 18 subjects.

To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation.

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner."}

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations.

In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead.

The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning. This work is a conceptual perspective that contributes a structural vocabulary for analyzing AI systems at the intersection of computation and society, without proposing a specific technical implementation."}

A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy.

Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity.

We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity).

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure.

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse.

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM."}

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods.

This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate."}

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends.

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \\cdot d \\log d)$ memory,sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150$\\times$ memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss. ButterflyMoE allows multiple experts to fit on edge-constrained devices showing that geometric parameterization breaks linear scaling."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

We prove that coherence optimization is equivalent to description-length regularization, and that among all such regularization schemes, it is optimal for semi-supervised learning when the regularizer is derived from a pretrained model. Our theory, supported by preliminary experiments, explains why feedback-free self-improvement works and predicts when it should succeed or fail."}

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation."}

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

However, existing block-based diffusion studies tend to introduce autoregressive priors, which, while offering benefits, can cause models to lose this global coherence at the macro level. To regain global contextual understanding while preserving the advantages of the semi-autoregressive paradigm, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a 'draft-then-refine' framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilize snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using only 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models."}

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

In this paper, we develop a loss function to mitigate the problem of degraded robustness under FAT. Specifically, we derive a quadratic upper bound (QUB) on the adversarial training (AT) loss function and propose to utilize the bound with existing FAT methods. Our experimental results show that applying QUB loss to the existing methods yields significant improvement of robustness. Furthermore, using various metrics, we demonstrate that this improvement is likely to result from the smoothened loss landscape of the resulting model."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Unlike black-box API consumption, the reliability of user-managed orchestration remains a critical blind spot. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.\n  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures. (3) Lifecycle Escalation: Barriers escalate from intrinsic configuration struggles during fine-tuning to compounded environmental incompatibilities during inference. Supported by our publicly available dataset, these insights provide actionable guidance for enhancing the reliability of the LLM landscape."}

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features.

Data-Dependent Trade-offs via Chernoff Information Neural Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Fairness and privacy are two vital pillars of trustworthy machine learning. Despite extensive research on these individual topics, the relationship between fairness and privacy has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we utilize the information-theoretic measure Chernoff Information to highlight the data-dependent nature of the relationship among the triad of fairness, privacy, and accuracy. We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets. This work builds towards a unified understanding of the fairness-privacy-accuracy relationship and highlights its data-dependent nature."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities.

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning.

Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues.

This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation.

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization.

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69% and 8.80% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task--for example, Time Masking with a 62% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop & Resize with a 77% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

While numerical fine-tuning excels at injecting new factual knowledge, symbolic updates offer flexible control of style and alignment without retraining. We introduce a neurosymbolic LoRA framework that dynamically combines these two complementary strategies. Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance. Our findings highlight the value of interleaving numerical and symbolic updates to unlock a new level of versatility in language model fine-tuning."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability."}

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document.

Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis.

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable."}

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points.

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics. These findings establish that the cost of thought is determined not by task difficulty but by manifold geometry - offering a blueprint for inference acceleration where topology permits."}

Gomes"], "title": "Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics", "comment": null, "summary": "We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics."}

Knight", "Mrinank Sharma", "Erik Jones"], "title": "Eliciting Harmful Capabilities by Fine-Tuning On Safeguarded Outputs", "comment": null, "summary": "Model developers implement safeguards in frontier models to prevent misuse, for example, by employing classifiers to filter dangerous outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning."}

Automated generation of issue reproduction tests from natural language issue descriptions enhances developer productivity by simplifying root cause analysis, promotes test-driven development -- \"test first, write code later\", and can be used for improving the effectiveness of automated issue resolution systems like coding agents. Existing methods proposed for this task predominantly rely on closed-source LLMs, with limited exploration of open models. To address this, we propose SWE-Tester -- a novel pipeline for training open-source LLMs to generate issue reproduction tests. First, we curate a high-quality training dataset of 41K instances from 2.6K open-source GitHub repositories and use it to train LLMs of varying sizes and families. The fine-tuned models achieve absolute improvements of up to 10\\% in success rate and 21\\% in change coverage on SWT-Bench Verified. Further analysis shows consistent improvements with increased inference-time compute, more data, and larger models. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework for advancing open-source LLMs in this domain."}

Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

A Tokyo-Based Pilot Study Using Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Environments", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper introduces Virtual Urbanism (VU), a multimodal AI-driven analytical framework for quantifying urban identity through the medium of synthetic urban replicas. The framework aims to advance computationally tractable urban identity metrics. To demonstrate feasibility, the pilot study Virtual Urbanism and Tokyo Microcosms is presented. A pipeline integrating Stable Diffusion and LoRA models was used to produce synthetic replicas of nine Tokyo areas rendered as dynamic synthetic urban sequences, excluding existing orientation markers to elicit core identity-forming elements. Human-evaluation experiments (I) assessed perceptual legitimacy of replicas; (II) quantified area-level identity; (III) derived core identity-forming elements. Results showed a mean identification accuracy of ~81%, confirming the validity of the replicas. Urban Identity Level (UIL) metric enabled assessment of identity levels across areas, while semantic analysis revealed culturally embedded typologies as core identity-forming elements, positioning VU as a viable framework for AI-augmented urban analysis, outlining a path toward automated, multi-parameter identity metrics."}

Clifton", "Luciano Del Corro", "Marinka Zitnik"], "title": "Autonomous Knowledge Graph Exploration with Adaptive Breadth-Depth Retrieval", "comment": null, "summary": "Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions."}
