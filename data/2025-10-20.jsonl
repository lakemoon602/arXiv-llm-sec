Even though traditional\nmachine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they\noften compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive\ninformation. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems\nthat regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated\nLearning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across\ninstitutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration\namong banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This\nsurvey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a\nnovel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance\nexposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio\noptimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike\nprior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems,\ndiscussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention\nand blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not\nwithout challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory\ncompliance make implementation far from easy.

As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors.

In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy\nleakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices,\ni.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely\nfail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be\ninstantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric\nproperties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions:\nDistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in\naugmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records\nfrom synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under\nrealistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both\nattacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the\npracticality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that\nSMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority\nrecords, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive\napplications."}

Effective and efficient scalable clone\ndetection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks.

The\ncandidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and\na commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though\nCodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates\nsuggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and\ntailored datasets are advantageous.

Early detection would significantly reduce computational costs. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification\nprotocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM\ndeveloper (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data\nbatches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the\nLLMs' language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can\nexpose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training.

Dynamic analyses could reveal such\nbehaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is\ntypically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise\ncode with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but\nunexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze\nprogram behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible\nto reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.\n  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify\npotential bugs.

Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured\nknowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical\ncapabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis\nmethod based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a\ndynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to\nautomatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and\nvisualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and\nanalysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results\nshow that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,\nrelationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas\nand tools for multi-dimensional data analysis."}

Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues.

Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs\nmore controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable\nshortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To\nevaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for\nassessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of\ninstruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length\ncontrol. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and\nDeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:\nthe highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that\nfewer than $25\\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.\nNotably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades\nfurther.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training\nin shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's\ninternal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models."}

Framed through the unifying\nperspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application\ndomains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency\nand effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE\nmotivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple\ndiffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped\nobjective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing\ngenerations that align more faithfully with textual attributes."}

While the popular Forward-Backward\nrepresentations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we\nempirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation\nerrors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning\nsometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot\nRL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that\nsimultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and\nrepresentation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in\nzero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable\nin-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a\ntask-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and\nmultimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE\nemploys expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to\ncapture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics.

The\ncandidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and\na commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though\nCodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers.

We review the\nexisting primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in\nNGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the\nPRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with\nregular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final\nliterature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we\nidentify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity,\nDecision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common\nchallenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE)\nframework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel\nunderstanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges\nto organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while\nAI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger\norganizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can\nhelp NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving\neffectiveness, engagement, and social impact."}

However, current quantum devices are\nhindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based\nquantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by\nprocess fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing\nstage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage\n(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two\nmodules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity\nwith limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize\nrouting. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,\noutperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit\ndepth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with\nstate-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization\nmethods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to\nprovide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing\nlearning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the\nprocess fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models."}

Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

Existing\npost-training verification solutions like Proof-of-Learning are impractical for\nLLMs due to their requirement for full retraining, lack of robustness against\nstealthy manipulations, and inability to provide early detection during\ntraining. Early detection would significantly reduce computational costs. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification\nprotocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM\ndeveloper (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data\nbatches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the\nLLMs' language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can\nexpose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training.
