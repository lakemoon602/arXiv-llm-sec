We present Sphinx, a unified framework for LLM-based PR review that addresses these limitations through three key components: (1) a structured data generation pipeline that produces context-rich, semantically grounded review comments by comparing pseudo-modified and merged code; (2) a checklist-based evaluation benchmark that assesses review quality based on structured coverage of actionable verification points, moving beyond surface-level metrics like BLEU; and (3) Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO), a novel training paradigm that uses rule-based, interpretable rewards to align model behavior with real-world review practices. Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\\% in checklist coverage. Together, Sphinx enables the development of PR review models that are not only fluent but also context-aware, technically precise, and practically deployable in real-world development workflows. The data will be released after review."}

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked \"Why is completion rate 80%?\", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work."}

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs."}

However, the robustness of link weight prediction against adversarial perturbations remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we formalize the link weight prediction attack problem as an optimization task that aims to maximize the prediction error on a set of target links by adversarially manipulating the weight values of a limited number of links. Based on this formulation, we propose an iterative gradient-based attack framework for link weight prediction, termed IGA-LWP. By employing a self-attention-enhanced graph autoencoder as a surrogate predictor, IGA-LWP leverages backpropagated gradients to iteratively identify and perturb a small subset of links. Extensive experiments on four real-world weighted networks demonstrate that IGA-LWP significantly degrades prediction accuracy on target links compared with baseline methods. Moreover, the adversarial networks generated by IGA-LWP exhibit strong transferability across several representative link weight prediction models. These findings expose a fundamental vulnerability in weighted network inference and highlight the need for developing robust link weight prediction methods."}

Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design."}

Backdoor-based LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a promising solution for this challenge. In practical application, the low-cost multi-model collaborative technique, LLM ensemble, combines diverse LLMs to leverage their complementary strengths, garnering significant attention and practical adoption. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of existing LLM fingerprinting for the ensemble scenario is unexplored. In order to comprehensively assess the robustness of LLM fingerprinting, in this paper, we propose two novel fingerprinting attack methods: token filter attack (TFA) and sentence verification attack (SVA). The TFA gets the next token from a unified set of tokens created by the token filter mechanism at each decoding step. The SVA filters out fingerprint responses through a sentence verification mechanism based on perplexity and voting. Experimentally, the proposed methods effectively inhibit the fingerprint response while maintaining ensemble performance. Compared with state-of-the-art attack methods, the proposed method can achieve better performance. The findings necessitate enhanced robustness in LLM fingerprinting."}

A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities."}

This is particularly problematic when personal attributes are integral to expressive or pragmatic goals. The central challenge lies in determining which attributes to protect, and to what extent, while preserving semantic and pragmatic functions. We propose IntentAnony, a utility-preserving anonymization approach that performs intent-conditioned exposure control. IntentAnony models pragmatic intent and constructs privacy inference evidence chains to capture how distributed cues support attribute inference. Conditioned on intent, it assigns each attribute an exposure budget and selectively suppresses non-intent inference pathways while preserving intent-relevant content, semantic structure, affective nuance, and interactional function. We evaluate IntentAnony using privacy inference success rates, text utility metrics, and human evaluation. The results show an approximately 30% improvement in the overall privacy--utility trade-off, with notably stronger usability of anonymized text compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model."}

While prior research has predominantly focused on polarization in the United States, there remains a limited body of research on political divides in multiparty systems, and no universal method for comparing fragmentation across countries. Moreover, cross-country comparison is rare. This study first develops a novel measure of structural political fragmentation built on multi-scale community detection and the effective branching factor. Using a dataset of 18,325 political influencers from Brazil, Spain, and the United States, we assess online fragmentation in their Twitter/X co-following networks. We compare the fragmentation of the three countries, as well as the ideological groups within each. We further investigate factors associated with the level of fragmentation in each country. We find that political fragmentation differs across countries and is asymmetric between ideological groups. Brazil is the most fragmented, with higher fragmentation among the left-wing group, while Spain and the United States exhibit similar overall levels, with the left more fragmented in Spain and the right more fragmented in the United States. Additionally, we find that social identity plays a central role in political fragmentation. A strong alignment between ideological and social identities, with minimal overlap between ideologies, tends to promote greater integration and reduce fragmentation. Our findings provide explanations for cross-national and ideological differences in political fragmentation."}

Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models."}

This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter.

Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.\n  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.\n  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.\n  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs."}

In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving localization scheme, named PPLZN. PPLZN protects protects the location privacy of both the target and anchor nodes in crowdsourced localization. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of PPLZN. Evidently, it can achieve accurate position estimation without location leakage and outperform state-of-the-art approaches in both positioning accuracy and communication overhead. In addition, PPLZN significantly reduces computational and communication overhead in large-scale deployments, making it well-fitted for practical privacy-preserving localization in resource-constrained networks."}

Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle."}

Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages.

A recent study provided important initial insights, but was largely limited in duration and geography, focusing primarily on European and U.S. network telescope deployments and covering the immediate aftermath of disclosure. As a result, the longer-term evolution of exploitation behavior and its regional characteristics has remained insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a longitudinal measurement study of Log4Shell-related traffic observed between December 2021 and October 2025 by an active network telescope deployed in India. This vantage point enables examination of sustained exploitation dynamics beyond the initial outbreak phase, including changes in scanning breadth, infrastructure reuse, payload construction, and destination targeting. Our analysis reveals that Log4Shell exploitation persists for several years after disclosure, with activity gradually concentrating around a smaller set of recurring scanner and callback infrastructures, accompanied by an increase in payload obfuscation and shifts in protocol and port usage. A comparative analysis and observations with the benchmark study validate both correlated temporal trends and systematic differences attributable to vantage point placement and coverage. Subsequently, these results demonstrate that Log4Shell remains active well beyond its initial disclosure period, underscoring the value of long-term, geographically diverse measurement for understanding the full lifecycle of critical software vulnerabilities."}

However, under conditions of rapid technological change, the inferential validity of such indicators becomes increasingly fragile. This article examines how, in adaptive educational systems, statistically correct inferences may nevertheless become systematically misleading when structural conditions change. Adopting a theory-informed interpretive approach, the paper conceptualises technological transitions as exogenous structural perturbations that reconfigure incentives, constraints, and participation strategies, without necessarily implying a deterioration of underlying student capabilities. Drawing on prior empirical evidence for illustrative purposes, the analysis identifies recurring patterns of inferential instability, including level shifts, trend reconfigurations, and increased heterogeneity across cohorts. The argument integrates insights from complex adaptive systems theory, the sociology of quantification, and measurement theory to show how strategic behavioural adaptation can decouple the meaning of performance metrics from the constructs they are intended to represent. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for inferential caution when interpreting educational metrics in contexts of structural and technological transformation."}

However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters."}

Paz"], "title": "Longitudinal Trends in Pre University Preparation. A Cohort Evaluation Using Introductory Mathematics and Physics Courses (1980-2019)", "comment": "22 pages, in Spanish language, 6 figures, 1 table", "summary": "The transition from secondary to higher education represents a critical point in academic trajectories, particularly in programmes with a strong emphasis on basic sciences. Across different higher education systems, introductory Mathematics and Physics courses consistently concentrate high rates of early failure and attrition, yet most available evidence relies on cross-sectional analyses or limited time spans. This study presents a longitudinal evaluation of pre-university preparation based on early academic outcomes in Mathematics and Physics, conceptualised as \"sensor\" courses of initial academic demands. Using complete administrative records from a large public university in Argentina, the analysis covers entry cohorts from 1980 to 2019 with census-level coverage and a population-based approach. Pre-university preparation is operationally defined as cohort-level compatibility between students' prior educational background and the functional demands of introductory university coursework, observed through first-attempt outcomes. For each cohort and by type of secondary school (public or private), we estimate the probability of course approval, the probability of non-attempt (enrolment without evaluative participation), and the public-private success gap. The results reveal consistent long-term patterns: a gradual decline in early approval probabilities, a sustained increase in non-attempt behaviour, and the persistence of moderate but stable public-private gaps. These findings point to structural changes in the articulation between secondary education and higher education rather than short-term fluctuations or individual-level effects. The study contributes to the international literature on educational evaluation by providing rare long-horizon longitudinal evidence from an Ibero-American context."}

We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions (\"position shift\") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts."}

We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception."}

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives."}
