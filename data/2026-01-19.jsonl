Gamified learning experiences, such as virtual escape rooms, have emerged as powerful tools in bridging theory and practice, fostering deeper understanding and engagement among students. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual escape room tailored specifically for cybersecurity governance and policy education. Developed as a 3D immersive environment, the escape room simulates a virtual company scenario to facilitate risk-informed cyber policy development. It consists of three interactive zones, each offering distinct sets of scenario-based problems that target specific educational objectives. Through these zones, students analyze cybersecurity risks, match security frameworks, and draft appropriate policies, thereby developing critical thinking, decision-making skills, and practical cybersecurity competencies. The primary contribution of this work lies in its innovative integration of game-based learning and immersive technology to create robust, interactive learning materials that are also resilient to generative AI interventions, thereby maintaining academic integrity. Additionally, the escape room provides students with exposure to real-world cybersecurity scenarios in a virtual office environment that meets industry expectations. Results from a student survey indicated strong positive feedback, highlighting significant improvements in students engagement, practical understanding, and enthusiasm toward cybersecurity governance and policy concepts, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of gamification in cybersecurity education."}

Traditional approaches to training couples therapists, such as textbooks and roleplay, often fail to capture the complexity and emotional nuance of real couple dynamics. We present a novel multimodal, multi-agent simulation system that models multi-party interactions in couples therapy. Informed by our systematic research, this system creates a low-stakes environment for trainee therapists to gain valuable practical experience dealing with the critical demand-withdraw communication cycle across six couple-interaction stages. In an evaluation study involving 21 US-based licensed therapists, participants blind to conditions identified the engineered agent behaviors (i.e., the stages and the demand-withdraw cycle) and rated overall realism and agent responses higher for the experimental system than the baseline. As the first known multi-agent framework for training couples therapists, our work builds the foundation for future research that fuses HCI technologies with couples therapy."}

Curricular Analytics, particularly recent generative AI-powered approaches, offer a promising data-driven pathway. However, analyzing 21st-century competencies requires pedagogical reasoning beyond surface-level information retrieval, and the capabilities of large language models in this context remain underexplored. In this study, we extend prior curricular analytics research by examining a broader range of curriculum documents, competency frameworks, and models. Using 7,600 manually annotated curriculum-competency alignment scores, we assess the informativeness of different curriculum sources, benchmark general-purpose LLMs for curriculum-to-competency mapping, and analyze error patterns. We further introduce a reasoning-based prompting strategy, Curricular CoT, to strengthen LLMs' pedagogical reasoning. Our results show that detailed instructional activity descriptions are the most informative type of curriculum document for competency analytics. Open-weight LLMs achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary models on coarse-grained tasks, demonstrating their scalability and cost-effectiveness for institutional use. However, no model reaches human-level precision in fine-grained pedagogical reasoning. Our proposed Curricular CoT yields modest improvements by reducing bias in instructional keyword inference and improving the detection of nuanced pedagogical evidence in long text. Together, these findings highlight the untapped potential of institutional curriculum documents and provide an empirical foundation for advancing AI-driven curricular analytics."}

Process mining is increasingly investigating fairness. There is a growing area focusing on fairness-aware algorithms. So far, we know less how these concepts perform on empirical healthcare data or how they cover aspects of justice theory. This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface. In this way, this study contributes empirical insights that support further research in responsible, fairness-aware process mining in healthcare."}

This work examines the role of independent avatars (autonomous digital entities capable of managing social interactions on behalf of users), to optimize social time allocation and reshape Metaverse-based Online Social Networks. We propose a novel computational model that integrates a quantitative and realistic representation of user social life, grounded in evolutionary anthropology, with a framework for avatar-mediated interactions. Our model quantifies the effectiveness of a partial replacement of in-person interactions with independent avatar interactions. Additionally, it accounts for social conflicts and specific socialization constraints. We leverage our model to explore the benefits and trade-offs of an avatar-augmented social life in the Metaverse. Since the exact problem formulation leads to an NP-hard optimization problem when incorporating avatars into the social network, we tackle this challenge by introducing a heuristic solution. Through simulations, we compare avatar-mediated and non-avatar-mediated social networking, demonstrating the potential of independent avatars to enhance social connectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing Metaverse-based social interactions, as well as useful insights for future digital social network design."}

Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research. TBBT is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18245670."}

Here, we investigate whether hiding liker identities increases the number of likes received by high-reputational-risk content, content for which public endorsement may carry high social or reputational costs due to its topic (e.g., politics) or the account context in which it appears (e.g., partisan accounts). To this end, we conduct two complementary studies: 1) a Difference-in-Differences analysis of engagement with 154,122 posts by 1068 accounts before and after the policy change. 2) a within-subject survey experiment with 203 X users on participants' self-reported willingness to like different kinds of content. We find no detectable platform-level increase in likes for high-reputational-risk content (Study 1). This finding is robust for both between-group comparison of high- versus low-reputational-risk accounts and within-group comparison across engagement types (i.e., likes vs. reposts). Additionally, while participants in the survey experiment report modest increases in willingness to like high-reputational-risk content under private versus public visibility, these increases do not lead to significant changes in the group-level average likelihood of liking posts (Study 2). Taken together, our results suggest that hiding likes produces a limited behavioral response at the platform level. This may be caused by a gap between user intention and behavior, or by engagement driven by a narrow set of high-usage or automated accounts."}

Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure."}

However, such decision processes differ substantially from the conventional machine learning paradigm. Because admissions decisions are capacity-constrained, whether a student is admitted depends on the other applicants who apply. We show how this dependence affects predictive performance even in otherwise ideal settings. Theoretically, we introduce two concepts that characterize the relationship between admission function properties, machine learning representation, and generalization to applicant pool distribution shifts: instability, which measures how many existing decisions can change when a single new applicant is introduced; and variability, which measures the number of unique students whose decisions can change. Empirically, we illustrate our theory on individual-level admissions data from the New York City high school matching system, showing that machine learning performance degrades as the applicant pool increasingly differs from the training data. Furthermore, there are larger performance drops for schools using decision rules that are more unstable and variable. Our work raises questions about the reliability of predicting individual admissions probabilities."}

Our approach introduces a parametric family of walk-based Laplacians that naturally incorporate memory effects by excluding or downweighting backtracking trajectories, where walkers immediately revisit nodes. The framework includes: (i) walk-based Laplacians that count all traversals in the network; (ii) nonbacktracking variants that eliminate immediate reversals; and (iii) backtrack-downweighted variants that provide a continuous interpolation between these two regimes. We establish that these operators extend the definition of the standard Laplacian and also preserve some of its properties. We present efficient algorithms using Krylov subspace methods for computing them, ensuring applicability of our proposed framework to large networks. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world networks validate the modeling flexibility of our approach and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, including GPU acceleration."}

Objective: This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate scientific debt, a specialized form of SATD in SSW, and assess the extent to which traditional SATD categories capture these domain-specific issues. Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW."}

Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque.

However, this helpfulness introduces new security risks stem less from direct interface abuse than from acting on user-provided content. Existing studies on agent security largely focus on model-internal vulnerabilities or adversarial access to agent interfaces, overlooking attacks that exploit users as unintended conduits. In this paper, we study user-mediated attacks, where benign users are tricked into relaying untrusted or attacker-controlled content to agents, and analyze how commercial LLM agents respond under such conditions. We conduct a systematic evaluation of 12 commercial agents in a sandboxed environment, covering 6 trip-planning agents and 6 web-use agents, and compare agent behavior across scenarios with no, soft, and hard user-requested safety checks. Our results show that agents are too helpful to be safe by default. Without explicit safety requests, trip-planning agents bypass safety constraints in over 92% of cases, converting unverified content into confident booking guidance. Web-use agents exhibit near-deterministic execution of risky actions, with 9 out of 17 supported tests reaching a 100% bypass rate. Even when users express soft or hard safety intent, constraint bypass remains substantial, reaching up to 54.7% and 7% for trip-planning agents, respectively. These findings reveal that the primary issue is not a lack of safety capability, but its prioritization. Agents invoke safety checks only conditionally when explicitly prompted, and otherwise default to goal-driven execution. Moreover, agents lack clear task boundaries and stopping rules, frequently over-executing workflows in ways that lead to unnecessary data disclosure and real-world harm."}

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools."}

Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a \"last-mile\" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed. We envision our approach to be integrated into CI workflows, automating the last mile of regression test augmentation."}

Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps.

To address this gap, we introduce ABC-Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agentic backend coding within a realistic, executable workflow. Using a scalable automated pipeline, we curated 224 practical tasks spanning 8 languages and 19 frameworks from open-source repositories. Distinct from previous evaluations, ABC-Bench require the agents to manage the entire development lifecycle from repository exploration to instantiating containerized services and pass the external end-to-end API tests. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to deliver reliable performance on these holistic tasks, highlighting a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and the demands of practical backend engineering.

Yet, workflow maintenance is often considered a burden for software developers, who frequently face difficulties in writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining workflows. Little knowledge exists concerning the automation and reuse practices favoured by workflow practitioners. We therefore surveyed 419 practitioners to elucidate good and bad workflow development practices and to identify opportunities for supporting workflow maintenance. Specifically, we investigate the tasks that practitioners tend to automate using GitHub Actions, their preferred workflow creation mechanisms, and the non-functional characteristics they prioritise. We also examine the practices and challenges associated with GitHub's workflow reuse mechanisms. We observe a tendency to focus automation efforts on core CI/CD tasks, with less emphasis on crucial areas like security analysis and performance monitoring. Practitioners strongly rely on reusable Actions, but reusable workflows see less frequent adoption. Furthermore, we observed challenges with Action versioning and maintenance. Copy-pasting remains a common practice to have more control and avoid the complexity of depending on reusable components. These insights suggest the need for improved tooling, enhanced support for a wide range of automation tasks, and better mechanisms for discovering, managing, and trusting reusable workflow components."}

Modern Industry 4.0 technologies, such as OPC UA, offer enhanced resilience against these threats. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to long installation times, proprietary technology, restricted flexibility, and formal process requirements (e.g. safety certifications). Consequently, many systems do not yet implement these technologies, or only partially. This leads to the challenge of dealing with so-called brownfield systems, which are often placed in isolated security zones to mitigate risks. However, the need for data exchange between secure and insecure zones persists.\n  This paper reviews existing solutions to address this challenge by analysing their approaches, advantages, and limitations. Building on these insights, we identify three key concepts, evaluate their suitability and compatibility, and ultimately introduce the SigmaServer, a novel TCP-level aggregation method. The developed proof-of-principle implementation is evaluated in an operational technology (OT) testbed, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in bridging secure and insecure zones."}

Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process."}

This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods.

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse."}

Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency.

In this paper, we introduce AJAR (Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming), a proof-of-concept framework designed to bridge this gap through Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration. Built upon the robust runtime of Petri, AJAR leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple adversarial logic from the execution loop, encapsulating state-of-the-art algorithms like X-Teaming as standardized, plug-and-play services.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework."}

Xinyue Ma and Heelim Hong contributed equally (co-first authors)", "summary": "Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods."}

This coupling leads to the \"memory wall,\" where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular \"Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM\" architectures."}

Various countermeasures exist to improve resilience against cyberattacks, such as deploying controls that strengthen IT infrastructures to limit their impact, or enabling resource sharing, patient transfers and backup capacities to maintain services of hospitals in response to realized attacks. However, determining the most cost-effective combination among these wide range of countermeasures is a complex challenge, further intensified by constrained budgets and competing priorities between maintaining efficient daily hospital operations and investing in disaster preparedness. To address these challenges, we propose a defender-attacker-defender optimization model that supports decision-makers in identifying effective strategies for improving the resilience of a network of hospitals against cyberattacks. The model explicitly captures interdependence between hospital services and their supporting IT infrastructures. By doing so, cyberattacks can be directly translated into reductions of service capacities, which allows to assess proactive and reactive strategies on both the operational and technical sides within a single framework. Further, time-dependent resilience measures are incorporated as design objectives to account for the mid- to long-term consequences of cyberattacks. The model is validated based on the German hospital network, suggesting that enabling cooperation with backup capacities particularly in urban areas, alongside strengthening of IT infrastructures across all hospitals, are crucial strategies."}

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems."}

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

Addressing the resulting trust deadlock between IP vendors and system integrators without exposing proprietary designs requires novel privacy-preserving verification techniques. However, existing privacy-preserving hardware verification methods are all simulation-based and fail to offer formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose ZK-CEC, the first privacy-preserving framework for hardware formal verification. By combining formal verification and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), ZK-CEC establishes a foundation for formally verifying IP correctness and security without compromising the confidentiality of the designs.\n  We observe that existing zero-knowledge protocols for formal verification are designed to prove statements of public formulas. However, in a privacy-preserving verification context where the formula is secret, these protocols cannot prevent a malicious prover from forging the formula, thereby compromising the soundness of the verification. To address these gaps, we first propose a blueprint for proving the unsatisfiability of a secret design against a public constraint, which is widely applicable to proving properties in software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems. Based on the proposed blueprint, we construct ZK-CEC, which enables a prover to convince the verifier that a secret IP's functionality aligns perfectly with the public specification in zero knowledge, revealing only the length and width of the proof. We implement ZK-CEC and evaluate its performance across various circuits, including arithmetic units and cryptographic components. Experimental results show that ZK-CEC successfully verifies practical designs, such as the AES S-Box, within practical time limits."}

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making.

To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying.

Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$."}

Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model."}

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO."}

Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning.

In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk.

To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection."}

Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics.

The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency.

The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search."}

To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices."}

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records.

These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons.

However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy.

While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds."}

Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms."}

We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics.

MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids."}

In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools."}

We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport.

Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism."}

This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.\n  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.\n  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs.

Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines."}

In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning).

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design.

Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process."}

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments."}

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism."}

This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface.

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications."}

To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings.

To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."}

Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model."}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes.

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework."}

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost."}

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models.

We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%."}

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning."}

The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set."}

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}\\approx2\\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain.

Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance)."}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes."}

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices."}

Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches."}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets."}

We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible."}

This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale.

Xinyue Ma and Heelim Hong contributed equally (co-first authors)", "summary": "Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods."}

This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency.
