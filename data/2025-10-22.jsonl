An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints", "comment": null, "summary": "Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly\ncommunication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and\nevaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs)\nintroduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are\nwritten. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs\nreshape scientific publishing remains limited.\n  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1\nmillion preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major\nrepositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a\nmulti-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series\nmodels, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic\nmodeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary\norientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and\nrevision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and\ndisproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive\nfields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as\nuniversal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths\nand widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper\nprovides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of\ngenerative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance\nframeworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled\nresearch ecosystem."}

In\ntotal, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches,\ndiscovering more than 10 \"new\" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys,\nGitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more.\n  We further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where\nwe uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a\nset of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which\nwere confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our\nresults reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with\nLLMs, so can attackers. This underscores the urgent need for proactive secret\nmanagement and stronger mitigation practices across the mobile ecosystem."}

To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based\non our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header\ntokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens\npossess the model's strong alignment priors.

However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment.

To fill this gap, we conduct the first\nlarge-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability,\ncompleteness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports\navailability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of\n470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest\ncollection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of\nPoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method,\nwhich combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to\nextract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of\nPoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled\nvulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an\nin-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our\nfindings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and\nexisting PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components\nrequired for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with\nvarious reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using\navailable PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for\nstakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in\nstrengthening software security."}

It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction)\nreproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart\nEditing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding\nelements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to\ntransform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user\ninstructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that\nreflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task\ncomplexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types,\npaired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness\nand the visual fidelity of rendered charts.

Recent progress in imitation\nlearning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that\nbehaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic\npolicies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during\ninference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In\ncontrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and\nnaturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics\nand reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We\npropose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized\nautoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide\ndecentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL\ndivergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while\npreserving RL scalability.

In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and\nis immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly\nefficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses\njust one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves\ndownstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable\nto strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as\nGRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of\nOSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing\npreference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to\nreasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and\npromising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to\nenhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security\nknowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw\nsecurity-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the\nsignificant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To\naddress these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code\ngeneration with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base\nconstruction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize\ndistillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security\nguidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a\nhierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base\nfrom top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each\nhierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated\nRESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure\ncode generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE\nimproves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed\nin-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness\nof individual components in RESCUE."}

However, their use has\ntraditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on\nestimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action\nspaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes\ncomputationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically\nemployed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,\nand an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their\npopularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In\nthis work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control\nthat revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key\narchitectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.\nWe evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard\nsimulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with\nstate-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.\nParticularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value\nfunctions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization\noutperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.\nWe have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C."}

To\noperationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,\nthe most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects\ngeneral intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,\nmemory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to\nevaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly \"jagged\"\ncognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in\nknowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in\nfoundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage.

Prior work\non closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make\n'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We\ntherefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is\nopen-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce\nvalid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.\nFirst-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean\n$\\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\\approx$ 1).\nCrucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of\nconstraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production\nof a valid item rather than error detection and principled,\nconstraint-sensitive repair.

In psychological and social value theories such\nas Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple\nvalue dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods\nencounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:\n1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,\nignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)\nthey struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those\nunderrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we\npropose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE\nalignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex\ninterdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal\nrelationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it\napplies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired\nvalue objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also\nprovides better interpretability.
