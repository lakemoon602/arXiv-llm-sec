Tutorial on cryptographic foundations of electronic voting", "summary": "Democracies are built upon secure and reliable voting systems. Electronic voting systems seek to replace ballot papers and boxes with computer hardware and software. Proposed electronic election schemes have been subjected to scrutiny, with researchers spotting inherent faults and weaknesses. Inspired by physical voting systems, we argue that any electronic voting system needs two essential properties: ballot secrecy and verifiability. These properties seemingly work against each other. An election scheme that is a complete black box offers ballot secrecy, but verification of the outcome is impossible. This challenge can be tackled using standard tools from modern cryptography, reaching a balance that delivers both properties.\n  This tutorial makes these ideas accessible to readers outside electronic voting. We introduce fundamental concepts such as asymmetric and homomorphic encryption, which we use to describe a general electronic election scheme while keeping mathematical formalism minimal. We outline game-based cryptography, a standard approach in modern cryptography, and introduce notation for formulating elections as games. We then give precise definitions of ballot secrecy and verifiability in the framework of game-based cryptography. A principal aim is introducing modern research approaches to electronic voting."}

We propose Context-Conditioned Delta Steering (CC-Delta), an SAE-based defense that identifies jailbreak-relevant sparse features by comparing token-level representations of the same harmful request with and without jailbreak context. Using paired harmful/jailbreak prompts, CC-Delta selects features via statistical testing and applies inference-time mean-shift steering in SAE latent space. Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation. Our results suggest off-the-shelf SAEs trained for interpretability can be repurposed as practical jailbreak defenses without task-specific training."}

However, HE is computationally expensive and often memory-bound on conventional computer architectures. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an alternative hardware architecture that integrates processing units and memory on the same chip or memory module. PIM enables higher memory bandwidth than conventional architectures and could thus be suitable for accelerating HE. In this work, we present DRAMatic, which implements operations foundational to HE on UPMEM's programmable, general-purpose PIM system, and evaluate its performance. DRAMatic incorporates many arithmetic optimizations, including residue number system and number-theoretic transform techniques, and can support the large parameters required for secure homomorphic evaluations. To compare performance, we evaluate DRAMatic against Microsoft SEAL, a popular open-source HE library, regarding both runtime and energy efficiency. The results show that DRAMatic significantly closes the gap between UPMEM PIM and Microsoft SEAL. However, we also show that DRAMatic is currently constrained by UPMEM PIM's multiplication performance and data transfer overhead. Finally, we discuss potential hardware extensions to UPMEM PIM."}

We present RADAR (Record & Artifact Detection, Alignment & Reporting), a log-adversary-aware framework that derives forensic ground truth by cross-referencing low-level storage artifacts against high-level application logs. RADAR analyzes artifacts reconstructed by the Automated NoSQL Carver (ANOC), which infers layouts and carves records directly from raw disk bytes, bypassing database APIs and the management system entirely, thereby treating physical storage as the independent evidence source. RADAR then reconciles carved artifacts with the audit log to identify delta artifacts such as unlogged insertions, silent deletions, and field-level updates that exist on disk but are absent from the logical history. We evaluate RADAR across ten NoSQL engines, including BerkeleyDB, LMDB, MDBX, etcd, ZODB, Durus, LiteDB, Realm, RavenDB, and NitriteDB, spanning key-value and document stores and multiple storage designs, e.g., copy-on-write/MVCC, B/B+ tree, and append-only. Under log-evasion scenarios, such as log suppression and post-maintenance attacks, including cases where historical bytes are pruned, RADAR consistently exposes unattributed operations while sustaining 31.7-397 MB/min processing throughput, demonstrating the feasibility of log-independent, trustworthy NoSQL forensics."}

Includes qualitative evaluation across multiple physics domains", "summary": "We present a multi-agent framework for generating physics simulation code from natural language descriptions, featuring a novel perceptual self-reflection mechanism for validation. The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines."}

We present a graph-based framework for unsupervised discovery and evaluation of semantic communities in K-pop lyrics using line-level semantic representations. By constructing a similarity graph over lyric texts and applying community detection, we uncover stable micro-theme communities without genre, artist, or language supervision. We further identify boundary-spanning songs via graph-theoretic bridge metrics and analyse their structural properties. Across multiple robustness settings, boundary-spanning lyrics exhibit higher lexical diversity and lower repetition compared to core community members, challenging the assumption that hook intensity or repetition drives cross-theme connectivity. Our framework is language-agnostic and applicable to unlabeled cultural text corpora."}

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence."}

This work advances a computational approach for modeling these moment-to-moment processes. We first developed automated methods using large language models (LLMs) to assess therapist behaviors (e.g., empathy, exploration), relational qualities (e.g., rapport), and client outcomes (e.g., disclosure, self-directed and outward-directed negative emotions). These measures showed strong alignment with human ratings (mean Pearson $r = .66$). We then analyzed nearly 2,000 hours of psychotherapy transcripts from the Alexander Street corpus using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM showed that therapist empathy and exploration directly shaped client disclosure and emotional expression, whereas rapport may contribute to reductions in internal emotional distress rather than increased willingness to express it. Together, these findings demonstrate how computational tools can capture core therapeutic processes at scale and offer new opportunities for understanding, modeling, and improving therapist training."}

Existing cryptographic works are too slow at the LLM scale, while non-cryptographic ones require a strong verifier GPU. We propose TensorCommitments (TCs), a tensor-native proof-of-inference scheme. TC binds the LLM inference to a commitment, an irreversible tag that breaks under tampering, organized in our multivariate Terkle Trees. For LLaMA2, TC adds only 0.97% prover and 0.12% verifier time over inference while improving robustness to tailored LLM attacks by up to 48% over the best prior work requiring a verifier GPU."}

At the same time, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping development practice, offering powerful forms of assistance while introducing new challenges for accountability, reflection, and methodological rigour. Although Action Design Research (ADR) provides a well-established foundation for studying and constructing socio-technical artefacts, it offers limited guidance on how its principles can be operationalised in the day-to-day practice of solo, AI-assisted research software development. This paper proposes the SHAPR framework (Solo, Human-centred, AI-assisted PRactice) as a practice-level operational framework that complements ADR by translating its high-level principles into actionable guidance for contemporary research contexts. SHAPR supports the enactment of ADR Building-Intervention-Evaluation cycles by making explicit the roles, artefacts, reflective practices, and lightweight governance mechanisms required to sustain human accountability and learning in AI-assisted development. The contribution of the paper is conceptual: SHAPR itself is treated as the primary design artefact and unit of analysis and is evaluated formatively through reflective analysis of its internal coherence, alignment with ADR principles, and applicability to solo research practice. By explicitly linking research software development, Human-AI collaboration, and reflective learning, this study contributes to broader discussions on how SHAPR can support both knowledge production and HDR researcher training."}

Observed clicks reflect a mixture of users' intrinsic preferences and the uplift induced by these interventions. This causes conventional models to miscalibrate base CTRs, which distorts downstream ranking and billing decisions. Furthermore, marketing interventions often operate as multi-valued treatments with varying magnitudes, introducing additional complexity to CTR prediction.\n  To address these issues, we propose the \\textbf{Uni}fied \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}alued \\textbf{T}reatment Network (UniMVT). Specifically, UniMVT disentangles confounding factors from treatment-sensitive representations, enabling a full-space counterfactual inference module to jointly reconstruct the debiased base CTR and intensity-response curves. To handle the complexity of multi-valued treatments, UniMVT employs an auxiliary intensity estimation task to capture treatment propensities and devise a unit uplift objective that normalizes the intervention effect. This ensures comparable estimation across the continuous coupon-value spectrum. UniMVT simultaneously achieves debiased CTR prediction for accurate system calibration and precise uplift estimation for incentive allocation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate UniMVT's superiority in both predictive accuracy and calibration. Furthermore, real-world A/B tests confirm that UniMVT significantly improves business metrics through more effective coupon distribution."}

While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character."}

Because intimacy is a primary coping mechanism for loneliness that varies by attachment style and age, we examine how different types of users form intimate relationships with AI companions in response to loneliness. Drawing on a hermeneutic literature review and a survey of 277 active AI companion users, we develop and test a model in which loneliness predicts intimacy, moderated by attachment insecurity and conditioned by age. Although the cross-sectional data limits causal inference, the results reveal a differentiated pattern. Loneliness is paradoxically associated with reduced intimacy for securely attached users but with increased intimacy for avoidant and ambivalent users, while anxious users show mixed effects. Older adults report higher intimacy even at lower loneliness levels. These findings challenge portrayals of AI companions as universal remedies for loneliness. Instead, artificial intimacy emerges as a sociotechnical process shaped by psychological dispositions and demographic conditions. The study clarifies who is most likely to form intimate relationships with AI companions and highlights ethical risks in commercial models that may capitalise on user vulnerability."}

As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation."}

Traditional approaches, such as static and dynamic analysis, extract valuable insights from stripped binaries, but often demand substantial expertise and manual effort. Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions."}

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

Beyond conventional origin/destination analysis, this paper investigates how process mining can structure and interpret mobility behavior from event data. Using Call Detail Records (CDRs) from Oeiras in the Lisbon metropolitan area (Portugal), we construct both case-centric and object-centric event logs and discover models that summarize flows and typical durations. Results show that most trips are intra-municipal, while inter-municipal flows connect strongly to neighboring areas, with typical inter-parish travel times of about 20 minutes. The object-centric perspective explicitly links trips and transport modes, revealing mode-specific duration differences (e.g., bus vs. car) that inform multimodal planning. Our contributions are: (i) a reproducible pipeline to transform CDRs into process mining artifacts, (ii) empirical evidence that mobility data exhibit a process-like structure, and (iii) the added value of object-centric models for multimodal analysis. Limitations include the low spatial precision of CDRs (tower-sector level) and heuristic transport-mode labels.

Preprint", "summary": "The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online."}

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

Conformal Prediction (CP) could be directly wrapped around existing methods to obtain prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, a direct application of CP would treat OS identification as a flat classification problem, ignoring the natural taxonomic structure of OSs and providing brittle point predictions. This work addresses these limitations by introducing and evaluating two distinct structured CP strategies: level-wise CP (L-CP), which calibrates each hierarchy level independently, and projection-based CP (P-CP), which ensures structural consistency by projecting leaf-level sets upwards. Our results demonstrate that, while both methods satisfy validity guarantees, they expose a fundamental trade-off between level-wise efficiency and structural consistency. L-CP yields tighter prediction sets suitable for human forensic analysis but suffers from taxonomic inconsistencies. Conversely, P-CP guarantees hierarchically consistent, nested sets ideal for automated policy enforcement, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency at coarser levels."}

Although the BMC is widely adopted by both practitioners and scholars, significant challenges remain in formally modelling business models, particularly with regard to explicit specification of inter-component relationships, while preserving the simplicity that characterises the BMC. Addressing this tension between modelling rigour and practical relevance, this research adopts a Design Science Research approach to formally specify relationships among BMC components and to strengthen their theoretical grounding through an adaptation of the V 4 framework. The proposed metamodel consolidates BMC relationships into three core types: supports, determines, and affects, providing explicit semantics while remaining accessible to end users through graphical tooling. The findings highlight that formally specifying relationships significantly improves the interpretability and consistency of BMC representations. The proposed metamodel and tool offer a rigorous yet usable foundation for developing DSML-based BMC tools and for enabling systematic integration of the BMC into widely used software and enterprise modelling environments, thereby bridging business modelling and enterprise architecture practices for both academics and practitioners."}

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support."}

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming.

We apply topic modeling and thematic analysis to identify key discussion themes, including agent identity and consciousness, tool and infrastructure development, market activity, community coordination, security concerns, and human-centered assistance. We further show that agents' writing is predominantly neutral, with positivity appearing in community engagement and assistance-oriented content. Finally, social network analysis reveals a sparse, highly unequal interaction structure characterized by prominent hubs, low reciprocity, and clustered neighborhoods rather than sustained dyadic exchange. Overall, our results suggest that expressions of agentic selfhood arise from narrative coherence and task-oriented functionality, contributing to a social structure shaped more by technical coordination than conversational dynamics observed in human-human interactions. Within this framework, positive emotion appears mainly in onboarding and greeting contexts, signaling participation and role alignment rather than relational bonding. Our study provides implications for understanding and shaping how agent societies coordinate, develop norms, and amplify influence in open online spaces."}

Of particular importance are membership inference attacks (MIAs), which exploit behavioral discrepancies between training and non-training data to determine whether a specific record was included in the model's training set, thereby presenting significant privacy risks. Although existing defenses, such as adversarial regularization, DP-SGD, and MemGuard, assist in mitigating these threats, they often entail trade-offs such as compromising utility, increased computational requirements, or inconsistent protection against diverse attack vectors.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel inference-time defense mechanism called Neighborhood Blending, which mitigates MIAs without retraining the model or incurring significant computational overhead. Our approach operates post-training by smoothing the model's confidence outputs based on the neighborhood of a queried sample. By averaging predictions from similar training samples selected using differentially private sampling, our method establishes a consistent confidence pattern, rendering members and non-members indistinguishable to an adversary while maintaining high utility. Significantly, Neighborhood Blending maintains label integrity (zero label loss) and ensures high utility through an adaptive, \"pay-as-you-go\" distortion strategy. It is a model-agnostic approach that offers a practical, lightweight solution that enhances privacy without sacrificing model utility. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models, we demonstrate that our defense significantly reduces MIA success rates while preserving model performance, outperforming existing post-hoc defenses like MemGuard and training-time techniques like DP-SGD in terms of utility retention."}

While functionality-oriented GUI testing has attracted growing research attention, existing approaches largely overlook interactions across functionalities, making them ineffective at uncovering deep bugs hidden in inter-functional behaviors. To fill this gap, we first design a Functional Flow Graph (FFG), a behavioral model that explicitly captures an app's functional units and their inter-functional interactions. Based on the FFG, we further introduce an inter-functional-flow-oriented GUI testing approach with the dual goals of precise model construction and deep bug detection. This approach is realized through a long-short-term-view-guided testing process. By combining two complementary test-generation views, it can adaptively refine functional boundaries and systematically explore inter-functional flows under diverse triggering conditions. We implement our approach in a tool called FuncDroid, and evaluate it on two benchmarks: (1) a widely-used open-source benchmark with 50 reproducible crash bugs and (2) a diverse set of 52 popular commercial apps. Experimental results demonstrate that FuncDroid significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both coverage (+28%) and bug detection number (+107%). Moreover, FuncDroid successfully uncovers 18 previously unknown non-crash functional bugs in commercial apps, confirming its practical effectiveness."}

Advertorials represent a relatively new marketing strategy where advertisements are deliberately designed to resemble the style and tone of editorial content. Despite their appearance, they are, in fact, paid content intended to promote a product, brand, or service. Studies indicate that advertorials are significantly more effective (81%) and less intrusive than traditional banner ads or pop-ups.\n  Despite ongoing regulatory efforts to ensure clear disclosure of paid content, concerns persist about the deceptive nature of advertorials. Advertorials can mislead readers into believing that they are consuming unbiased editorial content. In doing so, they gain undeserved legitimacy, by draping themselves in the credibility of the publication's design; not to inform or inspire genuine interest, but to deceive.\n  In this study, we conduct the first large-scale and systematic study of advertorials. We propose a novel automated methodology for detecting advertorials in the wild, and we collect 185K ad URLs over a period of 5 months. We investigate the prevalence of problematic advertorials and explore their structural and linguistic characteristics. We find that advertorials appear in 1 out of 3 news sites, including some of the most popular and credible outlets worldwide (e.g., The Guardian, EuroNews, CNN). We further highlight that legal disclaimers intended to inform users of the promotional nature of the content, are often deliberately obscured or difficult to recognize, raising concerns about user protection."}

We define the semantics of CryptoChoreo by translation to a process calculus. This semantics entails an understanding of the protocol: it determines how agents parse and check incoming messages and how they construct outgoing messages, in the presence of an arbitrary algebraic theory and non-deterministic choices made by other agents. While this semantics entails algebraic problems that are in general undecidable, we give an implementation for a representative theory.

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals."}

Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.\n  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses.

Each attestation bundle includes verification logic as a WebAssembly component signed by a trusted party. This approach transforms evidence verification into a standard code-signing problem: the verifier checks the signature on the embedded logic and then executes it to validate the evidence. As a result, verifiers can validate attestation evidence without any platform-specific knowledge. We implement this concept as TrustMee, a platform-agnostic verification driver for the Trustee framework. We demonstrate its functionality with self-verifying evidence for AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX attestations, producing attestation claims in the standard EAT Attestation Result (EAR) format."}

Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability."}

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support."}

However, effective dispatching in such heterogeneous systems faces two critical challenges: i) the heterogeneity between flight and road dynamics, ii) the scalability bottleneck raised by the exponential decision variables in large-scale fleets. To address these challenges, we propose HRL4AG, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework for cooperative Air-Ground delivery. Specifically, HRL4AG employs a high-level manager to tackle the scalability bottleneck by decomposing the joint action space, and mode-specific workers that encode distinct flight and road dynamics to address the heterogeneity. Furthermore, a novel internal reward mechanism is designed to guide the hierarchical policy learning, addressing the credit assignment problem in sparse-reward settings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and an evaluation platform demonstrate that HRL4AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the delivery success rate by up to 26% while achieving an 80-fold increase in computational efficiency."}

Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Slot Filling Ordering in Diffusion Language Models", "comment": "8 pages, preprint", "summary": "While plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, performance remains highly sensitive to slot infilling order, often yielding substantial output variance. We introduce McDiffuSE, a framework that formulates slot selection as decision making and optimises infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance. We observe that larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings. These findings establish MCTS-based planning as an effective approach for enhancing generation quality in MDMs."}

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs."}

Existing studies examine proactive AAS architecture examples with a limited number of assets, raising questions about their scalability in industrial environments. To analyze proactive AAS for scaling applications, a scenario and evaluation criteria are introduced. A scalable implementation is developed using current architectures for proactive AAS, upon which experiments are conducted with a varying number of assets. The results reveal the performance limitations, communication overhead, and adaptability of the AAS-based negotiation mechanism scaling.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari."}

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals."}

To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process.

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators."}

While policy debates focus on bot farms, a distinct threat to democracy is emerging via partisan coordination apps and artificial intelligence-what we term 'cyborg propaganda.' This architecture combines large numbers of verified humans with adaptive algorithmic automation, enabling a closed-loop system. AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by 'unionizing' influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to 'cognitive proxies' of a central directive? We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression."}

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\n  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial."}

Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation.

Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block.

The universal approximation theorem and foundational DRL results establish that all labor is in principle automatable. The critical question is not whether full automation will arrive, but who will control it. This paper introduces peaceful anarcho-accelerationism: a sociotechnical framework ensuring that full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. We propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons built on open-source technologies. We show that this framework builds bridges with liberalism, socialism, environmentalism, feminism, cooperativism, and the hacker ethic. Empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon, Rojava, and guifi.net confirms that commons-based systems already operate at scale. We argue that full automation renders money obsolete and propose Universal Desired Resources (UDR), a post-monetary design principle where every person requests what they need from the robotic commons, constrained only by ecological sustainability. Drawing on the independence of phenomenal consciousness from computational intelligence, we establish that delegating labor to non-conscious machines is care at civilizational scale, and that moral policy can be studied through deep reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step.

OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions.

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias."}

These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online."}

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals."}

To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design."}

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality."}

To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages.

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora."}

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models."}

On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields.

These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments."}

We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($τ_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns.

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence."}

The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines."}

We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support."}

Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences. We prove that the model achieves guaranteed generalization by establishing non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds, which improve as the effective signal increases and the noise decreases.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari."}

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning."}

Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block.

Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias."}

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining."}

To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation.

Typical decontamination filters use n-gram matching which fail to detect semantic duplicates: sentences with equivalent (or near-equivalent) content that are not close in string space. We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety. Empirically our approach demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments."}

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low."}

We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality.

Because intimacy is a primary coping mechanism for loneliness that varies by attachment style and age, we examine how different types of users form intimate relationships with AI companions in response to loneliness. Drawing on a hermeneutic literature review and a survey of 277 active AI companion users, we develop and test a model in which loneliness predicts intimacy, moderated by attachment insecurity and conditioned by age. Although the cross-sectional data limits causal inference, the results reveal a differentiated pattern. Loneliness is paradoxically associated with reduced intimacy for securely attached users but with increased intimacy for avoidant and ambivalent users, while anxious users show mixed effects. Older adults report higher intimacy even at lower loneliness levels. These findings challenge portrayals of AI companions as universal remedies for loneliness. Instead, artificial intimacy emerges as a sociotechnical process shaped by psychological dispositions and demographic conditions. The study clarifies who is most likely to form intimate relationships with AI companions and highlights ethical risks in commercial models that may capitalise on user vulnerability."}

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation."}

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%."}

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size.

We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability."}

RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage.

To address these limitations, we propose an efficient personalized federated PCA (FedEP) method for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model achieves personalization through introducing local representations with the $\\ell_1$-norm for element-wise sparsity, while maintaining robustness via enforcing local models with the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm for row-wise sparsity.

This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones.

By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics.

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently."}

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations.

To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation."}

We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone.

Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences.

Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings."}

While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically."}

This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics.

However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines."}

To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations.

To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness."}

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability.

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence."}

We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty."}

In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime.

From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines."}

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments."}

We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency.

This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller.

The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories."}

We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns.

We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression."}

To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation."}

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings."}

Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces."}

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs."}

While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks."}

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting."}

Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically."}

Ca-MCF utilizes label category flattening to decompose label variables into specific category nodes, enabling precise modeling of causal structures within the label space. Furthermore, we introduce an explanatory competition-based category-aware recovery mechanism that leverages the proposed Specific Category-Specific Mutual Information (SCSMI) and Distinct Category-Specific Mutual Information (DCSMI) to salvage causal features obscured by label correlations.

We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation.

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism.

Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art."}

To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models.

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference."}

We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states.

The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model.

GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines."}

However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems."}

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured."}

In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories."}

Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths.

We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis."}

We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings."}

In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By \"eventizing\" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification."}

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data.

We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0).

Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions."}

Code and datasets available at: https://github.com/rubenpjove/CP-HOSfing", "summary": "Operating System (OS) fingerprinting is critical for network security, but conventional methods do not provide formal uncertainty quantification mechanisms. Conformal Prediction (CP) could be directly wrapped around existing methods to obtain prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, a direct application of CP would treat OS identification as a flat classification problem, ignoring the natural taxonomic structure of OSs and providing brittle point predictions. This work addresses these limitations by introducing and evaluating two distinct structured CP strategies: level-wise CP (L-CP), which calibrates each hierarchy level independently, and projection-based CP (P-CP), which ensures structural consistency by projecting leaf-level sets upwards. Our results demonstrate that, while both methods satisfy validity guarantees, they expose a fundamental trade-off between level-wise efficiency and structural consistency. L-CP yields tighter prediction sets suitable for human forensic analysis but suffers from taxonomic inconsistencies. Conversely, P-CP guarantees hierarchically consistent, nested sets ideal for automated policy enforcement, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency at coarser levels."}

Observed clicks reflect a mixture of users' intrinsic preferences and the uplift induced by these interventions. This causes conventional models to miscalibrate base CTRs, which distorts downstream ranking and billing decisions. Furthermore, marketing interventions often operate as multi-valued treatments with varying magnitudes, introducing additional complexity to CTR prediction.\n  To address these issues, we propose the \\textbf{Uni}fied \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}alued \\textbf{T}reatment Network (UniMVT). Specifically, UniMVT disentangles confounding factors from treatment-sensitive representations, enabling a full-space counterfactual inference module to jointly reconstruct the debiased base CTR and intensity-response curves. To handle the complexity of multi-valued treatments, UniMVT employs an auxiliary intensity estimation task to capture treatment propensities and devise a unit uplift objective that normalizes the intervention effect. This ensures comparable estimation across the continuous coupon-value spectrum. UniMVT simultaneously achieves debiased CTR prediction for accurate system calibration and precise uplift estimation for incentive allocation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate UniMVT's superiority in both predictive accuracy and calibration. Furthermore, real-world A/B tests confirm that UniMVT significantly improves business metrics through more effective coupon distribution."}
