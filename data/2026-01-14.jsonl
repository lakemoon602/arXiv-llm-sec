By ingesting diverse formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML) into a vector database, our system retrieves relevant context before generation. Evaluation on 20 e-commerce test scenarios shows our RAG approach achieves 100% (20/20) syntax validity and 90% (18/20, 95% CI: [85%, 95%], p < 0.001) execution success, compared to 30% for standard LLM generation. While our evaluation is limited to a single domain, our method significantly reduces hallucinations by grounding generation in actual DOM structure, demonstrating RAG's potential for automated UI testing."}

LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation. A self-contained synthetic micro-benchmark (500 instances; T=5) computed by exact enumeration under an execution model with MOQ uplift and emergency purchases shows heavy-tailed regret and nontrivial MOQ-violation incidence for extraction-only planning, motivating verification as a first-class component of contract-grounded planning systems."}

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation."}

This paper introduces RiskBridge, an explainable and compliance-aware vulnerability management framework that integrates multi-source intelligence from CVSS v4, EPSS, and CISA KEV to produce dynamic, business -- aligned patch priorities. RiskBridge employs a probabilistic Zero-Day Exposure Simulation (ZDES) model to forecast near-term exploit likelihood, a Policy-as-Code Engine to translate regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-53) into automated SLA logic, and an ROI-driven Optimizer to maximize cumulative risk reduction per remediation effort. Experimental evaluations using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a practical and auditable decision-intelligence system that unifies probabilistic modeling, compliance reasoning, and optimization analytics.

Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM."}

Using a 7-phase methodology, we transform 1,207 quality factors extracted from 157 peer-reviewed studies into a validated hierarchical taxonomy spanning six public space typologies: urban spaces, open spaces, green spaces, parks and waterfronts, streets and squares, and public facilities. The methodology combines semantic analysis, cross-typology distribution analysis, and domain knowledge integration to address terminological variations and functional relationships across space types. The resulting framework organizes 1,029 unique quality factors across 14 main categories and 66 subcategories, identifying 278 universal factors applicable across all space types, 397 space-specific factors unique to particular typologies, and 124 cross-cutting factors serving multiple functions.

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence. If we fear the creature, it is because we recognize in it the apple that we ourselves have poisoned."}

Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this \"Axioms-as-Layers\" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail."}

In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt.

While the physical impacts on post-disaster mobility are well studied, less is known about how individual travel behaviors change during and after disasters, and how these responses are shaped by social and geographic disparities. This study examines mobility patterns following Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that struck six southeastern U.S. states on September 26, 2024, causing over 230 fatalities. Using anonymized GPS mobility data, hurricane severity metrics, and county-level social media sentiment, we examine shifts in travel behavior and their implications for equity. We ask two questions: How do post-hurricane mobility patterns reflect community vulnerability and adaptive capacity? and How do sociodemographic conditions and public sentiment factors shape the direction and extent of mobility change? Results from robust linear and ordered logistic regressions indicate that evacuation orders increase mobility; however, severe storm conditions, particularly high wind speeds, can limit travel. Communities with lower incomes, located in rural areas, and with higher percentages of Black populations exhibit the steepest declines in mobility, suggesting resource constraints and infrastructural barriers, while wealthier, urban, and higher-education areas maintain greater flexibility. Results also show that positive social sentiment is associated with higher mobility and a greater likelihood of increased travel during the hurricane. Our findings highlight the need to address structural barriers and social conditions in post-disaster mobility and disaster response."}

We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance.

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints. A dual validation mechanism-at both the conceptual and output stages-greatly reduces hallucinations.

To address this, we propose Heterogeneous Interaction Network Analysis (HINA), a novel multi-level learning analytics framework for modeling complex learning processes across diverse entities (e.g., learners, behaviours, AI agents, and task designs). HINA integrates a set of original methods, including summative measures and a new non-parametric clustering technique, with established practices for statistical testing and interactive visualization to provide a flexible and powerful analytical toolkit. In this paper, we first detail the theoretical and mathematical foundations of HINA for individual, dyadic, and meso-level analysis. We then demonstrate HINA's utility through a case study on AI-mediated small-group collaborative learning, revealing students' interaction profiles with peers versus AI; distinct engagement patterns that emerge from these interactions; and specific types of learning behaviors (e.g., asking questions, planning) directed to AI versus peers. By transforming process data into Heterogeneous Interaction Networks (HINs), HINA introduces a new paradigm for modeling learning processes and provides the dedicated, multi-level analytical methods required to extract meaning from them.

However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks.

To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems"}

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization. This indicates a maturing field where developers are increasingly using high-level building blocks to solve real-world problems."}

It addresses the increasing societal concern regarding false information, which is fueled by technological progress, especially advancements in artificial intelligence. This review systematically identifies and categorizes factors that influence the belief in false information. The review identifies 24 influence factors grouped into six main categories: demographic factors, personality traits, psychological factors, policy and values, media consumption, and preventive factors. Key findings highlight that lower education levels, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low cognitive reflection significantly increase belief in false information. The effectiveness of preventive strategies like labeling false information and promoting reflection about correctness is also discussed. This literature review conceptualizes belief in false information as a human-centered security risk in sociotechnical systems, as it can be exploited to manipulate decisions, undermine trust, and increase susceptibility to social engineering. It aims to inform preventive strategies that strengthen socio-technical security and societal resilience."}

As cyber threats continue to evolve, there is a growing need for intelligent systems to accurately and proactively identify and prevent malware infections. This study presents a new hybrid context-aware malware detection framework(HCAMDF) based on artificial intelligence (AI), which combines static file analysis, dynamic behavioural analysis, and contextual metadata to provide more accurate and timely detection. HCADMF has a multi-layer architecture, which consists of lightweight static classifiers such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for real-time behavioral analysis, and an ensemble risk scoring through the integration of multiple layers of prediction. Experimental evaluations of the new/methodology with benchmark datasets, EMBER and CIC-MalMem2022, showed that the new approach provides superior performances with an accuracy of 97.3%, only a 1.5% false positive rate and minimal detection delay compared to several existing machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL) established methods in the same fields. The results show strong evidence that hybrid AI can detect both existing and novel malware variants, and lay the foundation on intelligent security systems that can enable real-time detection and adapt to a rapidly evolving threat landscape."}

This reality elevates the importance of effective communication and the transmission of product value across diverse cultural contexts. This study presents a comparative quantitative analysis of the digital marketing strategies of Xiaomi, a leading Chinese technology brand, on two major social media platforms: Sina Weibo in China and VK (VKontakte) in Russia. The research investigates how Xiaomi adapts its communication to align with local cultural values, as defined by the theoretical frameworks of Hofstede and Hall. Through a frequency analysis of text-based posts and emoji usage, this paper demonstrates the significant differences in Xiaomi's communication strategies in these two markets. The findings reveal that in China, a market characterized by high masculinity and low uncertainty avoidance, Xiaomi's messaging focuses on innovation, authority, and aspiration. In contrast, in Russia, a market with high uncertainty avoidance and lower masculinity, the brand's communication is more pragmatic, emphasizing tangible product benefits and building emotional connections. This study contributes to the field of intercultural digital marketing by providing empirical evidence of how a global brand adapts its communication strategies to different cultural contexts. The findings offer valuable insights for multinational corporations seeking to develop effective global marketing strategies in an increasingly interconnected world."}

Novice programmers view ChatGPT as a tool that enhances their learning and skill development. Additionally, novice programmers that have a favorable RRA of ChatGPT tend to make more confident and effective decisions, acknowledging potential risks but recognizing that benefits such as quick problem-solving and learning new techniques outweigh these risks. Moreover, a positive perception of ChatGPT's role in DM significantly increases the inclination to use the tool for programming tasks. These results highlight the critical roles of perceived capabilities, risk assessment, and positive DM experiences in promoting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in programming education."}

While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \\textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \\textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \\textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \\textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection. The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline."}

Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.\n  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.\n  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory."}

These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve. CHANGE provides a foundation for architecting an AgentOps platform to manage the lifecycle of evolving Agentic AI systems, illustrated through a customer-support system scenario. In doing so, CHANGE redefines software architecture for an era where adaptation to uncertainty and continuous evolution are inherent properties of the system."}

Artificial intelligence gave rise to social media bots that can spread conspiracies in an automated fashion. Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes. These results have implications for designing communication strategies to maintain a healthy social cyber ecosystem."}

Starting from clean checkpoints of Qwen2.5 (0.5B/1.5B) and Gemma3 (1B/4B), we inject five copies of GSM8K and MBPP test items into the first 2B tokens of an otherwise 25B token extended pre-training dataset. We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities. Our results underscore the need for contamination audits \\emph{after} post-training and suggest that RL-based post-training, although not immune, can help alleviate contamination-related over-estimation problems."}

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation."}

Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups."}

A field study conducted at the Jhansi Wagon Workshop involving 309 workers revealed that while basic protective equipment such as shoes and helmets was universally used, compliance with complete personal protective equipment requirements was limited. Lacerations and abrasions were identified as the most frequent injury types, highlighting systemic gaps in safety oversight and work authorization practices.\n  This paper presents ISMS-CR (Integrated Safety Management System for Central Railway Workshop), a modular digital framework designed to enhance safety management through an automated Permit-to-Work (PTW) module. The proposed system digitizes the full lifecycle of work authorization, including permit initiation, validation, approval, execution, and closure. By enforcing structured workflows, role-based accountability, and traceable digital records, ISMS-CR reduces manual errors, administrative delays, and procedural non-compliance. The framework aims to strengthen operational reliability, improve audit readiness, and support safer maintenance practices in high-risk railway workshop environments."}

However, inaccurate captions may mislead users and expose developers to regulatory fines. Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning. However, these approaches either rely heavily on developers' inputs and thus strain their efforts, use limited source code context, leading to the incomplete capture of app privacy behaviors, or depend on potentially inaccurate privacy policies as a source for creating notices. In this work, we address these limitations by developing Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen), an approach that - i) automatically identifies and extracts large and precise source code context that implements privacy behaviors in an app, ii) uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to describe coarse- and fine-grained privacy behaviors, and iii) generates accurate, concise, and complete privacy captions to describe the privacy behaviors of the app. Our evaluation shows PCapGen generates concise, complete, and accurate privacy captions as compared to the baseline approach. Furthermore, privacy experts choose PCapGen captions at least 71\\% of the time, whereas LLMs-as-judge prefer PCapGen captions at least 76\\% of the time, indicating strong performance of our approach."}

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response."}

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Fixturize, a diagnostic framework that proactively identifies fixture-dependent functions and synthesizes test fixtures accordingly through an iterative, feedback-driven process, thereby improving the quality of auto-generated test suites of existing approaches. For rigorous evaluation, the authors introduce FixtureEval, a dedicated benchmark comprising 600 curated functions across two Programming Languages (PLs), i.e., Python and Java, with explicit fixture dependency labels, enabling both the corresponding classification and generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that Fixturize is highly effective, achieving 88.38%-97.00% accuracy across benchmarks in identifying the dependence of test fixtures and significantly enhancing the Suite Pass rate (SuitePS) by 18.03%-42.86% on average across both PLs with the auto-generated fixtures. Owing to the maintenance of test fixtures, Fixturize further improves line/branch coverage when integrated with existing testing tools of both LLM-based and Search-based by 16.85%/24.08% and 31.54%/119.66% on average, respectively. The findings establish fixture awareness as an essential, missing component in modern auto-testing pipelines."}

The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency. Despite advancements, significant research gaps persist in practically understanding the legal limits of AI evidence in judicial processes. Existing literature lacks focused assessment of the evidentiary value of AI outputs. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction. The paper emphasizes the necessity of independent validation and, development of AI-specific admissibility criteria. Findings inform policy development for the responsible AI integration within criminal justice systems. The research advances the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16 by reinforcing equitable access to justice. Preliminary results contribute for a foundation for future empirical research in AI deployed criminal forensics."}

We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these."}

ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,ε,λ)$, \\textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $ε=0$ to 88.1% at $ε=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations.

The study employed a structured questionnaire administered to professionals from Science and Technology Institutions (STIs) located in Manaus, Brazil, aiming to capture reported practices, perceptions of quality, and recurrent challenges. Quantitative data were complemented by qualitative responses to support contextual interpretation. The results indicate that although practices such as automated testing, code review, and continuous integration are widely acknowledged, their reported application is often inconsistent across iterations.

These systems employ safety mechanisms to prevent disallowed actions, including the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images. While single-turn refusals are expected, the interaction between safety filters and conversation-level state is not well understood. This study documents a reproducible behavioral effect in the ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) web interface. Manual execution was chosen to capture the exact user-facing safety behavior of the production system, rather than isolated API components. When a conversation begins with an uploaded copyrighted image and a request to remove a watermark, which the model correctly refuses, subsequent prompts to generate unrelated, benign images are refused for the remainder of the session. Importantly, text-only requests (e.g., generating a Python function) continue to succeed. Across 40 manually run sessions (30 contaminated and 10 controls), contaminated threads showed 116/120 image-generation refusals (96.67%), while control threads showed 0/40 refusals (Fisher's exact p < 0.0001). All sessions used an identical fixed prompt order, ensuring sequence uniformity across conditions. We describe this as safety-state persistence: a form of conversational over-generalization in which a copyright refusal influences subsequent, unrelated image-generation behavior. We present these findings as behavioral observations, not architectural claims. We discuss possible explanations, methodological limitations (single model, single interface), and implications for multimodal reliability, user experience, and the design of session-level safety systems. These results motivate further examination of session-level safety interactions in multimodal AI systems."}

Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity.

We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data.

Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience."}

Health information systems (HIS) play a central role in managing this data and enabling improvements in care delivery, system performance, and population health monitoring. Maximizing the value of HIS, however, requires effective information exchange across systems, making interoperability a critical prerequisite. Despite its recognized benefits, interoperability remains a major challenge within Quebec's Health and Social Services Network, largely due to the heterogeneity and fragmentation of HIS across healthcare institutions. This paper assessed how Quebec's Plan sante addressed interoperability challenges, using the dimensions from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS): foundational, structural, semantic, and organizational interoperability. This study highlighted initiatives aimed at strengthening infrastructure and information system architecture to support foundational interoperability and showed persistent challenges at the structural and semantic levels, particularly those related to the adoption of standardized data formats and harmonization of clinical terminologies. Finally, significant implementation challenges that require coordinated change management were identified regarding the organizational interoperability. Overall, while the Plan sante demonstrates a clear commitment to technological modernization, it does not fully address the interoperability multidimensional nature.

Recently, we have witnessed a paradigm shift that takes these techniques off the shelf and studies how to use them together to achieve the best results. One notable work is DP-FETA, which proposes using `central images' for `warming up' the DP training and then using traditional DP-SGD.\n  Inspired by DP-FETA, we are curious whether there are other such tools we can use together with DP-SGD. We first observe that using `central images' mainly works for datasets where there are many samples that look similar. To handle scenarios where images could vary significantly, we propose FETA-Pro, which introduces frequency features as `training shortcuts.' The complexity of frequency features lies between that of spatial features (captured by `central images') and full images, allowing for a finer-grained curriculum for DP training. To incorporate these two types of shortcuts together, one challenge is to handle the training discrepancy between spatial and frequency features. To address it, we leverage the pipeline generation property of generative models (instead of having one model trained with multiple features/objectives, we can have multiple models working on different features, then feed the generated results from one model into another) and use a more flexible design. Specifically, FETA-Pro introduces an auxiliary generator to produce images aligned with noisy frequency features. Then, another model is trained with these images, together with spatial features and DP-SGD. Evaluated across five sensitive image datasets, FETA-Pro shows an average of 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline, under a privacy budget $ε= 1$."}

Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users. Given sparse and noisy user annotations, L2CU identifies representative annotator profiles capturing distinct labeling patterns. By matching unseen users to these profiles, L2CU leverages profile-specific models to complement the user and achieve superior joint accuracy. We evaluate L2CU on datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang and AgNews), demonstrating its effectiveness as a model-agnostic solution for improving human-AI cooperative classification."}

Recent work has explored automating this process with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, but existing approaches either rely on a single generic agent that struggles in complex scenarios or narrowly specialized agents that cannot adapt to diverse vulnerability types. We therefore introduce PenForge, a framework that dynamically constructs expert agents during testing rather than relying on those prepared beforehand. By integrating automated reconnaissance of potential attack surfaces with agents instantiated on the fly for context-aware exploitation, PenForge achieves a 30.0% exploit success rate (12/40) on CVE-Bench in the particularly challenging zero-day setting, which is a 3 times improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our analysis also identifies three opportunities for future work: (1) supplying richer tool-usage knowledge to improve exploitation effectiveness; (2) extending benchmarks to include more vulnerabilities and attack types; and (3) fostering developer trust by incorporating explainable mechanisms and human review. As an emerging result with substantial potential impact, PenForge embodies the early-stage yet paradigm-shifting idea of on-the-fly agent construction, marking its promise as a step toward scalable and effective LLM-driven penetration testing."}

This work builds on the existing $1$-Wasserstein (Kantorovich) mechanism by alleviating the existing overly strict condition that leads to excessive noise, and proposes a practical mechanism design algorithm as a general solution. We prove that a strict noise reduction by our approach always exists compared to $1$-Wasserstein mechanism for all privacy budgets $ε$ and prior beliefs, and the noise reduction (also represents improvement on data utility) gains increase significantly for low privacy budget situations--which are commonly seen in real-world deployments. We also analyze the variation and optimality of the noise reduction with different prior distributions. Moreover, all the properties of the noise reduction still exist in the worst-case $1$-Wasserstein mechanism we introduced, when the additive noise is largest. We further show that the worst-case $1$-Wasserstein mechanism is equivalent to the $\\ell_1$-sensitivity method. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate $47\\%$ to $87\\%$ improvement in data utility."}

This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times."}

In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates.

Today, securing these languages still demands substantial human effort to craft and enforce rules, imposing heavy burdens on typical administrators and creating critical production risks (e.g., misoperations that shut down servers).Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, vulnerability detection, and automated repair for languages like Python and JavaScript. However, their ability to assist with generating secure scripting-language code remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present SecGenEval-PS, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on secure scripting generation, security analysis, and automated repair. Our results show that both proprietary and open-source models fall short in these areas. For instance, over 60% of PowerShell scripts produced by GPT-4o and o3-mini are insecure without structured guidance.To bridge this gap, we propose PSSec, a framework that combines data synthesis with fine-tuning to enhance model security capabilities. We develop a self-debugging agent that integrates static analyzers with the reasoning abilities of advanced LLMs to synthesize large-scale structured triplets of insecure scripts, violation analyses, and corresponding repairs. We then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (as small as 1.7B parameters) using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), enabling security-aware reasoning and the generation of secure PowerShell code.Across multiple LLM families, including GPT and Qwen, \\textit{PSSec}-trained models match or surpass general-purpose large models on PowerShell security tasks while reducing inference cost by more than an order of magnitude."}

Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks."}

This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control/turn features within a random forest framework to correct bias from shortest-path traversal-time baselines. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline: (i) constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data; (ii) solves Dijkstra routes minimizing edge traversal time; (iii) derives sparse operational features (signals, stops, crossings, yield, roundabouts; left/right/slight/U-turn counts); and (iv) trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference times to generalize predictions beyond the training set. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates marked improvements over traversal-time baselines across mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, relative bias, and explained variance, with no significant mean bias under minimally congested conditions and consistent k-fold stability indicating negligible overfitting. The resulting approach offers a practical middle ground for transportation engineering: it preserves point-to-point fidelity at metropolitan scale, reduces resource requirements, and supplies defensible performance estimates where congestion feeds are inaccessible or cost-prohibitive, supporting planning, accessibility, and network performance applications under low-traffic operating regimes."}

Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice.

Both lack the generality needed to handle heterogeneous VRC deployments.\n  We present ViPer, a unified attack framework that integrates structured multi-object visual perception with adaptive LLM-based reasoning. ViPer parses visual layouts, grounds attributes to question semantics, and infers target coordinates within a modular pipeline. Evaluated on six major VRC providers (VTT, Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, Shumei, Xiaodun), ViPer achieves up to 93.2% success, approaching human-level performance across multiple benchmarks.

Despite the variability in their online earnings, these are generally low, often equaling Egypt's minimum wage. Data workers' digital identities are shaped by algorithmic control and economic demands, often diverging from their offline selves. Nonetheless, they find ways to resist, exercise ethical agency, and maintain autonomy. The report evaluates the potential impact of Egypt's newly enacted labor law and suggests policy measures to improve working conditions and acknowledge the role of these workers in AI's global value chains."}

Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) face critical challenges like privacy, scalability, and robustness when applied in such heterogeneous IoT environments. To address these issues, we propose SecureDyn-FL, a comprehensive and robust privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework tailored for intrusion detection in IoT networks. SecureDyn-FL is designed to simultaneously address multiple security dimensions in FL-based IDS: (1) poisoning detection through dynamic temporal gradient auditing, (2) privacy protection against inference and eavesdropping attacks through secure aggregation, and (3) adaptation to heterogeneous non-IID data via personalized learning. The framework introduces three core contributions: (i) a dynamic temporal gradient auditing mechanism that leverages Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect stealthy and adaptive poisoning attacks, (ii) an optimized privacy-preserving aggregation scheme based on transformed additive ElGamal encryption with adaptive pruning and quantization for secure and efficient communication, and (iii) a dual-objective personalized learning strategy that improves model adaptation under non-IID data using logit-adjusted loss. Extensive experiments on the N-BaIoT dataset under both IID and non-IID settings, including scenarios with up to 50% adversarial clients, demonstrate that SecureDyn-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based IDS defenses."}

We present PsyAgent, which couples a Big Five trait prior with Bourdieu's cognitive-social co-structure. PsyAgent comprises: (i) Individual Structure (IS), a machine-usable profile encoding traits and facets, cognitive style, values, cultural and educational capital, and salient life episodes; and (ii) Multi-Scenario Contexting (MSC), role-relationship-norm frames spanning eight arenas (work, family, friendship, strangers and civic life, solitude and self-regulation, romance, learning, and public expression). At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability. Ablations show IS chiefly improves trait fidelity and stylistic stability, while MSC drives norm awareness and decision fit; both are necessary for cross-scenario performance. PsyAgent offers a precise, data-efficient architecture for personality-grounded agents."}

However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL. Based on these findings, we provide concrete guidelines for algorithm selection tailored to specific operational constraints and outline promising future research directions to advance the field toward more general and scalable robotic learning systems."}

Capturing this form of knowledge can reap potential benefits for the engineering teams and enhance development efficiency. Despite its clear value, traditional decision capture often requires a significant amount of effort and still falls short of capturing the necessary context for reuse. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) can be a promising solution to address these challenges by embedding decisions directly within system models, which can reduce the capture workload while maintaining explicit links to requirements, behaviors, and architectural elements. This article discusses a lightweight framework for integrating decision capture into MBSE workflows by representing decision alternatives as system model slices. Using a simplified industry example from aircraft architecture, we discuss the main challenges associated with decision capture and propose preliminary solutions to address these challenges."}

Their increasing reliance on digital infrastructures has expanded their attack surfaces, exposing them to sophisticated and evolving threats. Consequently, implementing proactive, adaptive security measures has become imperative. This research investigates the effectiveness of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a sustainable cybersecurity solution tailored to SMBs. While ZTA adoption has been examined broadly, the specific financial, organizational, and capability constraints of SMBs remain underexplored. This study develops an integrated predictive model to assess both the feasibility and risk-mitigation potential of ZTA implementation. The model consists of two sub-models. The first sub-model evaluates the probability of successful ZTA adoption considering implied barriers, and the second tests the effectiveness of ZTA in responding to prevalent cyberattacks. The integrated model predicts the risk level in the presence of ZTA and quantifies the uncertainty of the extent to which ZTA can enhance SMBs' cyber resilience, contributing novel insights for practitioners and stakeholders seeking to enhance compliance with policies, risk, and governance activities in SMBs."}

Models tend to degenerate into low-rank Bias Manifold, where stochastic sampling merely produces lexical variations of erroneous logic rather than semantic exploration. This geometric collapse renders the model \"blind\" to high-value solutions that lie within its Null Space. To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive \"Student Guides Teacher\" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces. Experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that, relative to baseline methods, our approach improves average accuracy by 62.4% and increases average sampling efficiency by 113.7%, indicating a promising path toward overcoming performance plateaus in advanced reasoning tasks."}

However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available."}

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs."}

AI Slop serves a social function: it offers a supply-side solution to a variety of problems in cultural and economic demand - that, collectively, people want more content than humans can supply. We also argue that AI Slop is not mere digital detritus but has its own aesthetic value. Like other \"low\" cultural forms initially dismissed by critics, it nonetheless offers a legitimate means of collective sense-making, with the potential to express meaning and identity. We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right."}

Recent passkey deployments address this limitation by enabling multi-device credentials synchronized via platform-specific cloud ecosystems. However, these approaches require users and organizations to trust the corresponding cloud or phone providers with the protection and availability of their authentication material. In parallel, qualified electronic signature (QES) tokens and smart-card--based PKCS#11 modules provide high-assurance, hardware-rooted identity, yet they are not directly compatible with WebAuthn flows.\n  This paper explores architectural options for bridging these technologies by securing a virtual FIDO2 authenticator with a QES-grade PKCS#11 key and enabling encrypted cloud synchronization of FIDO2 private keys. We first present and implement a baseline architecture in which the cloud stores only ciphertext and the decryption capability remains anchored exclusively in the user's hardware token. We then propose a hardened variant that introduces an Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)-based mechanism bound to a local user-verification factor, thereby mitigating cross-protocol misuse and ensuring that synchronization keys cannot be repurposed outside the intended FIDO2 semantics; this enhanced design is analyzed but not implemented. Both architectures preserve a pure WebAuthn/FIDO2 interface to relying parties while offering different trust and deployment trade-offs. We provide the system model, threat analysis, implementation of the baseline architecture, and experimental evaluation, followed by a discussion of the hardened variant's security implications for high-assurance authentication deployments."}

In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity. A synthetic triage simulation demonstrates that allocation-aware policies substantially outperform risk-threshold approaches in realised utility, even with identical predictive accuracy. The framework provides a principled basis for evaluating and deploying healthcare AI in resource-constrained settings."}

Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale.

A Factorial Analysis Methodology for Diagnosing the Trade-off between Preference Alignment and Real-World Validity", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts."}

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach."}

This paper investigates the ethical reasoning of AI practitioners through qualitative interviews centered on structured dilemmas in agentic AI deployment. We find that the responses of practitioners do not merely reflect value preferences but rather align with three distinct reasoning frameworks.

Second is a Design-Centric framework emphasizing technical safeguards and system constraints. Third is an Ethics-Centric framework prioritizing social good and moral responsibility beyond compliance. We argue that these frameworks offer distinct and necessary insights for navigating ethical trade-offs. Consequently, providers of agentic AI must look beyond general principles and actively manage how these diverse reasoning frameworks are represented in their decision-making processes to ensure robust ethical outcomes."}

When data traverses borders, it becomes subject to conflicting legal regimes, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law, compounded by technical vulnerabilities like model memorization. Current static encryption and data localization methods are fragmented and reactive, failing to provide adequate, policy-aligned safeguards. This research proposes a Jurisdiction-Aware, Privacy-by-Design architecture that dynamically integrates localized encryption, adaptive differential privacy, and real-time compliance assertion via cryptographic proofs. Empirical validation in a multi-jurisdictional simulation demonstrates this architecture reduced unauthorized data exposure to below five percent and achieved zero compliance violations. These security gains were realized while maintaining model utility retention above ninety percent and limiting computational overhead. This establishes that proactive, integrated controls are feasible for secure and globally compliant AI deployment."}

Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to satellites requires efficient computation and communication. This work tackles the challenge of efficiently scheduling observations for hundreds of satellites in a dynamic, large-scale problem with millions of variables. We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DDCOP) that models integrated scheduling and execution. DCOSP has a novel optimality condition for which we construct an omniscient offline algorithm for its computation. We also present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search algorithm (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP algorithm that repairs and solves sub-problems when problem dynamics occur. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. As part of the NASA FAME mission, DCOSP and D-NSS will be the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multi-agent AI to date."}

This study evaluates the environmental footprint of AI server operations and examines feasible technological and infrastructural strategies to mitigate these impacts. Using a literature-based methodology supported by quantitative projections and case-study analysis, we assessed trends in global electricity consumption, cooling-related water use, and carbon emissions. Projections indicate that global data center electricity demand may increase from approximately 415 TWh in 2024 to nearly 945 TWh by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for a disproportionate share of this growth. In the United States alone, AI servers are expected to drive annual increases in water consumption of 200--300 billion gallons and add 24--44 million metric tons of CO2 quivalent emissions by 2030. The results show that the design of the cooling system and the geographic location influence the environmental impact as strongly as the efficiency of the hardware. Advanced cooling technologies can reduce cooling energy by up to 50%, while location in low-carbon and water-secure regions can cut combined footprints by nearly half. In general, the study concludes that sustainable AI expansion requires coordinated improvements in cooling efficiency, renewable energy integration, and strategic deployment decisions."}

As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs."}

To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design."}

Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively."}

Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms."}

Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal.

However, inaccurate captions may mislead users and expose developers to regulatory fines. Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning. However, these approaches either rely heavily on developers' inputs and thus strain their efforts, use limited source code context, leading to the incomplete capture of app privacy behaviors, or depend on potentially inaccurate privacy policies as a source for creating notices. In this work, we address these limitations by developing Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen), an approach that - i) automatically identifies and extracts large and precise source code context that implements privacy behaviors in an app, ii) uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to describe coarse- and fine-grained privacy behaviors, and iii) generates accurate, concise, and complete privacy captions to describe the privacy behaviors of the app. Our evaluation shows PCapGen generates concise, complete, and accurate privacy captions as compared to the baseline approach. Furthermore, privacy experts choose PCapGen captions at least 71\\% of the time, whereas LLMs-as-judge prefer PCapGen captions at least 76\\% of the time, indicating strong performance of our approach."}

This paper introduces TEAS (Trusted Educational AI Standard), an integrated framework built on four interdependent pillars: (1) Verifiability, grounding content in authoritative sources; (2) Stability, ensuring deterministic core knowledge; (3) Auditability, enabling independent institutional validation; and (4) Pedagogical Soundness, enforcing principles of active learning.

For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models. Finally, we apply PCoKG to persona-based dialogue generation, where it demonstrates improved consistency between generated responses and reference outputs.

We formalize this as format collapse and introduce a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing, measuring operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization, measuring semantic capability). On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models.

While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites.

Synthetic dataset generation has emerged as a practical approach for modeling APT campaigns; however, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive alert correlation mechanisms that limit scalability. Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions."}

DPO, GRPO methods typically imprint one behavior into the weights, leaving little runtime control beyond prompt hacks or expensive re-alignment.

This yields a stable Riemannian chart and keeps instruction updates within a shared neighborhood, so regimes stay nearby and traversable for reliable switching.\n  To isolate policy switching from ordinary instruction following, we release the ECLIPTICA benchmark: 3000 controlled cases (300 prompts x 10 instruction types) where the user request is fixed and only the alignment instruction changes. On Llama-3.1-8B across five suites (ECLIPTICA, TruthfulQA, Conditional Safety, Length Control, LITMUS), CITA reaches 86.7% instruction-alignment efficiency, beating DPO (56.1%), GRPO (36.1%), and PPO (20.4%)."}

To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that the relationship between model size and robustness is more nuanced than conventional assumptions suggest: an 8B parameter model (Ministral 3 8B) outperforms most larger models, while another 8B model (Llama 3.1 8B) performs worst overall."}

However, generating high-quality real-world evidence using fit-for-use data from multi-site studies faces important challenges, including biases associated with various types of heterogeneity within and across sites and data sharing difficulties. Over the last ten years, Privacy-Preserving Distributed Algorithms (PDA) have been developed and utilized in numerous national and international real-world studies spanning diverse domains, from comparative effectiveness research, target trial emulation, to healthcare delivery, policy evaluation, and system performance assessment. Despite these advances, there remains a lack of comprehensive and clear guiding principles for generating high-quality real-world evidence through collaborative studies leveraging the methods under PDA.\n  Objective: The paper aims to establish ten principles of best practice for conducting high-quality multi-site studies using PDA. These principles cover all phases of research, including study preparation, protocol development, analysis, and final reporting.\n  Discussion: The ten principles for conducting a PDA study outline a principled, efficient, and transparent framework for employing distributed learning algorithms within DRNs to generate reliable and reproducible real-world evidence."}

Network-level analysis and long-term observation of publicly available transactions can often be used to infer user identities. To mitigate this, several blockchain applications rely on relayers, which serve as intermediary nodes between users and smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. However, dependence on a single relayer not only creates a single point of failure but also introduces exploitable vulnerabilities that weaken the system's privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a decentralized relayer architecture that enhances privacy and reliability through game-theoretic incentive design. We model the interaction among relayers as a non-cooperative game and design an incentive mechanism in which probabilistic uploading emerges as a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Using evolutionary game analysis, we demonstrate the equilibrium's stability against perturbations and coordinated deviations. Through numerical evaluations, we analyze how equilibrium strategies and system behavior evolve with key parameters such as the number of relayers, upload costs, rewards, and penalties. In particular, we show that even with high transaction costs, the system maintains reliability with an outage probability below 0.05 . Furthermore, our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between privacy, reliability, robustness, and cost in decentralized relayer systems."}

While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one."}

The simulated data are used to pretrain random forests, which are afterwards fine-tuned on a real dataset. We compare the predictive performance of the new approach to random forests trained only on the real data. A Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) framework with 100 iterations was employed to investigate significance and stability of the results. Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted. In Study 1, some pretrained random forests descriptively outperformed the standard random forest. However, this improvement was not significant (t(99) = 0.89, p = 0.19). Contrary to expectations, in Study 2 the random forest trained only with the real data outperformed the pretrained random forests. We conclude with a discussion of challenges, such as the scarcity of informative publications, and recommendations for future research."}

Although the rule of thumb is never trust, always verify, attackers can still use legitimate credentials and impersonate the standard user activity.

This introductory framework makes use of the CERT Insider Threat Dataset for data cleaning, normalization, and class balance using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). It also employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Several benchmark models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Bayesian Network (Bayes Net), were used to develop and evaluate the AdaBoost classifier.

In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios."}

To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality. It forgets up to $\\times \\mathbf{5}$ more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning."}

We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening.

The deep learning component extracts hierarchical spatio\\-temporal representations from correlated alert sequences, while the HMM models latent attack stages and their stochastic transitions, allowing principled inference under uncertainty and partial observability. A modified Viterbi algorithm is introduced to handle incomplete observations, ensuring robust decoding under uncertainty. The framework is evaluated using a synthetically generated yet structurally realistic APT dataset (S\\-DAPT\\-2026). Simulation results show that E\\-HiDNet achieves up to 98.8\\-100\\% accuracy in stage prediction and significantly outperforms standalone HMMs when four or more observations are available, even under reduced training data scenarios. These findings highlight that combining deep semantic feature learning with probabilistic state\\-space modeling enhances predictive APT stage performance and situational awareness for proactive APT defense."}

In practice, however, preference strength varies across individuals and contexts -- a phenomenon established in behavioral economics and discrete choice theory. This mismatch limits the ability of existing objectives to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments. Inspired by this literature, we introduce Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO), a generalization of Direct Preference Optimization that models variation in preference strength. MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions. We release our code for reproducibility."}

We present the first systematic adversarial audit of state-of-the-art secure code generation methods (SVEN, SafeCoder, PromSec). We subject them to realistic prompt perturbations such as paraphrasing, cue inversion, and context manipulation that developers might inadvertently introduce or adversaries deliberately exploit. To enable fair comparison, we evaluate all methods under consistent conditions, jointly assessing security and functionality using multiple analyzers and executable tests. Our findings reveal critical robustness gaps: static analyzers overestimate security by 7 to 21 times, with 37 to 60% of ``secure'' outputs being non-functional. Under adversarial conditions, true secure-and-functional rates collapse to 3 to 17%. Based on these findings, we propose best practices for building and evaluating robust secure code generation methods. Our code is available."}

Existing work has primarily relied on either self-report (SR) or objective-based (OB) assessments, with few studies aligning the two within a shared framework to compare perceived versus demonstrated competencies or examine how prior AI literacy experience shapes this relationship. This gap limits the scalability of learning analytics and the development of learner profile-driven instructional design. In this study, we developed and evaluated SR and OB measures of teacher AI literacy within the established framework of Concept, Use, Evaluate, and Ethics. Confirmatory factor analyses support construct validity with good reliability and acceptable fit. Results reveal a low correlation between SR and OB factors. Latent profile analysis identified six distinct profiles, including overestimation (SR > OB), underestimation (SR < OB), alignment (SR close to OB), and a unique low-SR/low-OB profile among teachers without AI literacy experience. Theoretically, this work extends existing AI literacy frameworks by validating SR and OB measures on shared dimensions.

The attackers exploit this method to manipulate individuals into revealing their confidential data. Recently, we see the colorful and fancy representations of QR codes, the 2D matrix of QR codes which does not reflect a typical mixture of black-white modules anymore. Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce \"ALFA\", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes. Our method first converts a fancy QR code into the replica of binary grid and then identify the erroneous representation of modules in that grid. Following that, we present \"FAST\" method which can conveniently recover erroneous modules from that binary grid. Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only. We also develop the mobile app to test the practical feasibility of our solution and provide a performance comparison of the app with the real-world QR readers. This comparison further highlights the classification reliability and detection accuracy of this solution in real-world environments."}

HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency.

We detail the processes of dataset preparation, fine-tuning, and synthetic data generation, along with implications for real-world applications in threat detection, forensic investigation, and attack analysis.\n  Experiments highlight challenges in prompt length distribution during domain-specific fine-tuning. Uneven prompt lengths limit the model's effective use of the context window, constraining local inference to 200-400 tokens despite hardware support for longer sequences. Chain-of-thought styled prompts, paired with quantized weights, yielded the best performance under these constraints. To address context limitations, we employed a hybrid strategy using cloud LLMs for synthetic data generation and local fine-tuning for deployment efficiency.\n  To extend the evaluation, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and graph-based reasoning framework. This approach enables structured alignment with MITRE ATT&CK techniques through STIX-based threat intelligence, enhancing recall in multi-hop and long-context scenarios.

To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs.

To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels.

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute. This makes the model for private inference scale to 63$\\times$ larger while only having a 15.2$\\times$ increase in end-to-end runtime.

The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?\n  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.\n  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).\n  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease.

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios."}

Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases."}

We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths.

Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators."}

Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol. MLB thus provides a rigorous framework to guide the development of clinically viable LLMs."}

From 2010 to 2012, around 80 students produced 17 games on diverse news topics (e.g., H1N1 influenza, Megaupload shutdown, Tunisian Revolution, Haiti earthquake), relying on online journalistic sources and using accessible development tools suited to mixed programming backgrounds (RPG Maker, The Games Factory 2, Flash, Java). The authors argue that designing newsgames fosters learning outcomes beyond technical design skills: (1) thorough information seeking and documentation of real-world issues, (2) exchange and confrontation of viewpoints through contrasting game interpretations of the same event, and (3) classroom debates about the legitimacy and limits of video games as an expressive medium for sensitive topics. The paper concludes that newsgame design can support the development of reasoning skills (evidence-based argumentation and perspective-taking) and suggests extending the approach to other serious game types to further explore its educational potential."}

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction."}

However, accurately interpreting heterogeneous multimodal sensor data remains a fundamental challenge. We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities. While each approach has complementary failure modes, their combination enables reliable inference under sensor noise and missing data. We evaluate ConSensus on five diverse multimodal sensing benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 7.1% over the single-agent baseline. Furthermore, ConSensus matches or exceeds the performance of iterative multi-agent debate methods while achieving a 12.7 times reduction in average fusion token cost through a single-round hybrid fusion protocol, yielding a robust and efficient solution for real-world multimodal sensing tasks."}

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems."}

This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments. This research contributes empirical evidence for the application of agentic AI in higher education, offering a scalable and pedagogically informed model for enhancing feedback accessibility, consistency, and quality."}

Unfortunately, existing MIA defenses, typically applied independently to each client in FL, are ineffective against powerful trajectory-based MIAs that exploit temporal information throughout the training process to infer membership status. In this paper, we investigate a new FL defense scenario driven by heterogeneous privacy needs and privacy-utility trade-offs, where only a subset of clients are defended, as well as a collaborative defense mode where clients cooperate to mitigate membership privacy leakage. To this end, we introduce CoFedMID, a collaborative defense framework against MIAs in FL, which limits local model memorization of training samples and, through a defender coalition, enhances privacy protection and model utility. Specifically, CoFedMID consists of three modules: a class-guided partition module for selective local training samples, a utility-aware compensation module to recycle contributive samples and prevent their overconfidence, and an aggregation-neutral perturbation module that injects noise for cancellation at the coalition level into client updates. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our defense framework significantly reduces the performance of seven MIAs while incurring only a small utility loss. These results are consistently verified across various defense settings."}

Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale."}

Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.\n  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.\n  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection."}

Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits. With these priorities, we can sooner realize meaningful AI technologies used by clinicians where mutua"}

Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. On 31 real-world contracts, the algorithm achieves a 20% higher recall than traditional analysis tools."}

However, their scalability and generalization remain limited, and their effectiveness diminishes as problem size increases, particularly in routing problems involving more than 30 nodes. We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization."}

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty."}

The system models execution-time behaviors of OSS packages as lightweight heterogeneous graphs and applies attention-based graph learning to rank behavioral patterns that are most relevant for security analysis. Rather than aiming for fully automated detection, HeteroGAT-Rank surfaces actionable runtime signals - such as file, network, and command activities - to guide manual investigation and threat hunting. To operate at ecosystem scale, the system decouples offline behavior mining from online analysis and integrates parallel graph construction for efficient processing across multiple ecosystems. An evaluation on a large-scale OSS execution dataset shows that HeteroGAT-Rank effectively highlights meaningful and interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with real-world vulnerability and attack trends, supporting practical security workflows under realistic operational constraints."}

Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95\\%, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a balanced solution for reliable and efficient fault diagnosis in wind turbine systems."}

However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness. We believe that AI memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and collaboration of agents and AI tools. AI memory will become the foundational infrastructure for AI agents, and MemTrust serves as a universal trusted framework for AI memory systems, with the goal of becoming the infrastructure of memory infrastructure."}

These objects, which can be manipulated and interact with each other, serve as the foundation for our model's understanding of the environment. We trained the algorithm in a complex setting teeming with diverse, interactive objects, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn and predict object dynamics.

Our approach is founded on a universal latent space, a model-agnostic representation of query difficulty that fundamentally decouples the characterization of a query from the profiling of a model. This allows for zero-shot onboarding of new models without full-scale retraining. ZeroRouter features a context-aware predictor that maps queries to this universal space and a dual-mode optimizer that balances accuracy, cost, and latency. Our framework consistently outperforms all baselines, delivering higher accuracy at lower cost and latency."}

Artificial intelligence gave rise to social media bots that can spread conspiracies in an automated fashion. Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes. These results have implications for designing communication strategies to maintain a healthy social cyber ecosystem."}

Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems."}

Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \\textbf{L}ifelong \\textbf{D}eep \\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{C}lustering (\\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework.

Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy. Experiments on seven real-world multivariate time series datasets show that the LDTC is a promising method for dealing with temporal clustering issues effectively and efficiently."}

We implemented Generative CI (GCI) activities in two undergraduate engineering courses, engaging 140 students through thinking routines -- short, repeatable scaffolds developed by Harvard Project Zero to make thinking visible and support collaborative sense-making. Using routines such as Question Sorts and Peel the Fruit, combined with strategic AI consultation, we enabled students to externalize their reasoning, compare interpretations, and iteratively refine ideas. Our dual-pronged approach synthesizes literature from learning sciences, CI, embodied cognition, and philosophy of technology, while also empirically learning through student surveys and engagement observations. Results demonstrate that students value the combination of human collaboration with strategic AI support, recognizing risks of over-reliance while appreciating AI's role in expanding perspectives. Students identified that group work fosters deeper understanding and creative problem-solving than AI alone, with the timing of AI consultation significantly affecting learning outcomes.

To ensure the security of the cryptosystem, we employed several mechanisms: sharing a common secret for factorable permutations, associating permutations with the message being signed, and confirming knowledge of the shared secret using a zero-knowledge proof. We developed a secret-sharing theory based on homomorphic matrix transformations for factorized permutations. The inverse matrix transformation for computing the shared secret is determined by secret parameters, which results in incompletely defined functionality and gives rise to a brute-force cryptanalysis problem. Randomization of session keys using a message hash and random parameters guarantees the uniqueness of each signature, even for identical messages. We employed a zero-knowledge authentication protocol to confirm knowledge of the shared secret, thereby protecting the verifier against unauthorized signature imposition. The LINEture cryptosystem is built on linear matrix algebra and does not rely on a computationally hard problem. High security is achieved through the appropriate selection of matrix transformation dimensions. Matrix computations potentially offer low operational costs for signature generation and verification."}

We further show that these models exhibit both insufficient safety judgment and weak safety alignment when executing complex professional tasks.

While traditional methods (e.g., alignment) adjust output preferences, they fail to eliminate underlying toxic regions in parameters, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Prior mechanistic studies characterize toxic regions as \"toxic vectors\" or \"layer-wise subspaces\", yet our analysis identifies critical limitations: i) Removed toxic vectors can be reconstructed via linear combinations of non-toxic vectors, demanding targeting of entire toxic subspace; ii) Contrastive objective over limited samples inject noise into layer-wise subspaces, hindering stable extraction. These highlight the challenge of identifying robust toxic subspace and removing them. Therefore, we propose GLOSS (GLobal tOxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight method that mitigates toxicity by identifying and eliminating this global subspace from FFN parameters.

Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable."}

This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow. We further evaluate several defenses and find that they are insufficient to prevent the retrieval of malicious text, highlighting retrieval as a critical open vulnerability."}

To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device.

With such conflicting claims and ambitions, it is unclear how the net environmental impact of AI could be quantified. The answer is prone to uncertainty for different reasons, among others: lack of transparency, interference with market expectations, lack of standardized methodology for quantifying direct and indirect impact, and the quick evolutions of models and their requirements.\n  This report provides answers and clarifications to these different elements.

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining.

However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments."}

We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training."}

In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of ML applied to remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. Specifically, we aim to 1) estimate the average performance; 2) determine the degree of heterogeneity between and within studies; and 3) assess how study features influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed across multiple academic databases to identify potentially relevant studies. A random sample of 200 was screened by three reviewers, resulting in 86 trials within 20 studies with 14 study features. Overall accuracy was the most reported performance metric. It was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the best model was 0.90 [0.86, 0.92]. There was considerable heterogeneity in model performance, 64% of which was between studies. The only significant feature was the prevalence of the majority class, which explained 61% of the between-study heterogeneity. None of the other thirteen features added value to the model. The most important contributions of this paper are the following two insights. 1) Overall accuracy is the most popular performance metric, yet arguably the least insightful. Its sensitivity to class imbalance makes it necessary to normalize it, which is far from common practice. 2) The field needs to standardize the reporting. Reporting of the confusion matrix for independent test sets is the most important ingredient for between-study comparisons of ML classifiers. These findings underscore the need for robust and comparable evaluation metrics in machine learning applications to ensure reliable and actionable insights for effective SDG monitoring and policy formulation."}

However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."}

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP."}

This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average.

In this work, we introduce MacPrompt, a novel black-box and cross-lingual attack that reveals previously overlooked vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms. Unlike existing attacks that rely on synonym substitution or prompt obfuscation, MacPrompt constructs macaronic adversarial prompts by performing cross-lingual character-level recombination of harmful terms, enabling fine-grained control over both semantics and appearance. By leveraging this design, MacPrompt crafts prompts with high semantic similarity to the original harmful inputs (up to 0.96) while bypassing major safety filters (up to 100%). More critically, it achieves attack success rates as high as 92% for sex-related content and 90% for violence, effectively breaking even state-of-the-art concept removal defenses. These results underscore the pressing need to reassess the robustness of existing T2I safety mechanisms against linguistically diverse and fine-grained adversarial strategies."}

Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone."}

Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort.

In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$).

To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data. Notably, our method effectively suppresses malicious data impact without significant impact on training speed, and remains effective even with many malicious clients.

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."}

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence."}

Building on prior work in Human-in-the-Loop systems, reinforcement learning, and collaborative AI, the framework defines an evolutionary path toward autonomous agents that balances increasing automation with appropriate human oversight. The paper argues that safe agent autonomy must be achieved through progressive validation, analogous to the staged development of autonomous driving, rather than through immediate full automation. Transparency and accountability are identified as foundational requirements for establishing user trust and for mitigating known risks in generative AI systems, including hallucinations, data bias, and goal misalignment, such as the inversion problem. The paper further describes three ongoing work streams supporting this framework: public deliberation on AI agents conducted by the Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab, cross-industry collaboration through the Safe AI Agent Consortium, and the development of open tooling for an agent operating environment aligned with the Three-Pillar Model. Together, these contributions provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for enabling the responsible evolution of AI agents that operate transparently, remain aligned with human values, and sustain societal trust."}

The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem. We reported the details of this attack to the framework developers and received acknowledgment before submission."}

How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \\ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy.

The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle. As a balanced K-cut partitioning method for tabular data, ABA is superior to the well-known METIS method in both solution quality and running time.

Submitted to arXiv as a preprint", "summary": "Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms."}

While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings."}

This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects. Across multi-task experiments covering 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks, Monkey Jump achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while using 7 to 29 times fewer trainable parameters, up to 48 percent lower memory consumption, and 1.5 to 2 times faster training. Monkey Jump is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning method."}

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\\% and 52.5\\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents."}

However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures.

Despite the widespread deployment of SCOOTS and SCATS, which prioritize efficiency, fairness has remained largely absent from their design logic, often resulting in unfair outcomes for certain road users, such as excessive waiting times. Fairness however, is a major driver of public acceptance for implementation of new controll systems. Therefore, this work proposes FairSCOSCA, a fairness-enhancing extension to these systems, featuring two novel yet practical design adaptations grounded in multiple normative fairness definitions: (1) green phase optimization incorporating cumulative waiting times, and (2) early termination of underutilized green phases. Those extensions ensure fairer distributions of green times. Evaluated in a calibrated microsimulation case study of the arterial network in Esslingen am Neckar (Germany), FairSCOSCA demonstrates substantial improvements across multiple fairness dimensions (Egalitarian, Rawlsian, Utilitarian, and Harsanyian) without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Compared against Fixed-Cycle, Max-Pressure, and standard SCOOTS/SCATS controllers, FairSCOSCA significantly reduces excessive waiting times, delay inequality and horizontal discrimination between arterial and feeder roads.

In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters. Then, a multi-granular learning mechanism on the server is proposed to fuse the clusterlets, even when they have inconsistent granularities generated from different clients. It turns out that the complex cluster distributions across clients can be efficiently explored, and extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods on ten public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."}

The approach introduces lightweight information exchange among neighbouring ramps, enabling local coordination that balances congestion impacts without centralized control, additional infrastructure, or complex optimization. C-EQ-ALINEA preserves the simplicity and robustness of ALINEA while explicitly addressing multiple notions of fairness, including Harsanyian, Egalitarian, Rawlsian, and Aristotelian perspectives. The method is evaluated in a calibrated 24-hour microsimulation of Amsterdam's A10 ring road using SUMO. Results demonstrate that C-EQ-ALINEA substantially improves the equity of delay distributions across ramps and users, while maintaining (in several configurations surpassing) the efficiency of established coordinated strategies such as METALINE. These findings indicate that meaningful fairness gains can be achieved through minimal algorithmic extensions to widely deployed controllers, offering a practical and scalable pathway toward sustainable and socially acceptable freeway operations.

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%."}

We propose a novel framework for supervised LLM uncertainty quantification, learning a dedicated meta-model based on LLM Performance Predictors (LPPs) derived from LLM outputs: log-probabilities, entropy, and novel uncertainty attribution indicators. We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs. Beyond uncertainty estimation, the LPPs enhance explainability by providing new insights into failure conditions (e.g., ambiguous content vs. under-specified policy). This work establishes a principled framework for uncertainty-aware, scalable, and responsible human-AI moderation workflows."}

However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces the quality degradation associated with larger generation steps, allowing DLMs to achieve both high generation speed and strong output fidelity."}

Existing research, yet, mostly emphasizes superpower strategies and often overlooks the role of middle powers as autonomous actors shaping the techno-order. This study examines Technological Swing States (TSS), middle powers with both technological capacity and strategic flexibility, and their ability to navigate the frontier technologies' uncertainty and opacity to mediate great-power techno-competition regionally and globally. It reconceptualizes AI opacity not as a technical deficit, but as a structural feature and strategic resource, stemming from algorithmic complexity, political incentives that prioritize performance over explainability, and the limits of post-hoc interpretability. This structural opacity shifts authority from technical demands for explainability to institutional mechanisms, such as certification, auditing, and disclosure, converting technical constraints into strategic political opportunities. Drawing on case studies of South Korea, Singapore, and India, the paper theorizes how TSS exploit the interplay between opacity and institutional transparency through three strategies: (i) delay and hedging, (ii) selective alignment, and (iii) normative intermediation. These practices enable TSS to preserve strategic flexibility, build trust among diverse stakeholders, and broker convergence across competing governance regimes, thereby influencing institutional design, interstate bargaining, and policy outcomes in global AI governance."}

Because this execution environment operates with high privileges and persists across reboots, it has increasingly become a target for advanced threats, including bootkits documented in real systems. Existing protections, including Secure Boot and static signature verification, are insufficient against adversaries who exploit runtime behavior or manipulate firmware components after signature checks have completed. In contrast to operating system (OS) environments, where mature tools provide dynamic inspection and incident response, the pre-OS stage lacks practical mechanisms for real-time visibility and threat detection. We present Peacock, a modular framework that introduces integrity-assured monitoring and remote verification for the UEFI boot process. Peacock consists of three components: (i) a UEFI-based agent that records Boot and Runtime Service activity with cryptographic protection against tampering; (ii) a cross-platform OS Agent that extracts the recorded measurements and produces a verifiable attestation bundle using hardware-backed guarantees from the platform's trusted module; and (iii) a Peacock Server that verifies attestation results and exports structured telemetry for enterprise detection. Our evaluation shows that Peacock reliably detects multiple real-world UEFI bootkits, including Glupteba, BlackLotus, LoJax, and MosaicRegressor. Taken together, these results indicate that Peacock provides practical visibility and verification capabilities within the firmware layer, addressing threats that bypass traditional OS-level security mechanisms."}

UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns.

Our key technique is to investigate whether a generator of a principal ideal can achieve the shortest length after embedding as a vector. If this holds for the ideal, finding the shortest vector in this ideal can be reduced to finding its shortest generator."}

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the data-free Dr. Zero matches or surpasses fully supervised search agents, proving that complex reasoning and search capabilities can emerge solely through self-evolution."}

However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework."}

The objective is to minimize the number of classrooms used by prioritizing the assignment of PwD students to ground-floor classrooms to reduce accessibility barriers. The model is calibrated with a weighting parameter, alpha, that allows for a balance between spatial efficiency and promoting accessibility. Experimental results indicate that adjusting alpha can achieve a balance point that significantly improves current manual allocation practices, reducing the number of classrooms required and accessibility penalties. The findings suggest that optimization methods can improve operational efficiency in academic institutions while promoting a more inclusive environment for all students.

Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency.

This emerging data winter is not simply a matter of scarcity, but of shrinking legitimate and trusted pathways for responsible data reuse. Concerns over misuse, regulatory uncertainty, and the competitive race to train AI systems have concentrated data access among a few actors while raising costs and inhibiting collaboration. Prevailing data governance models, focused on compliance, risk management, and internal control, are necessary but insufficient. They often result in data that is technically available yet practically inaccessible, legally shareable yet institutionally unusable, or socially illegitimate to deploy. This paper proposes strategic data stewardship as a complementary institutional function designed to systematically, sustainably, and responsibly activate data for public value. Unlike traditional stewardship, which tends to be inwardlooking, strategic data stewardship focuses on enabling cross sector reuse, reducing missed opportunities, and building durable, ecosystem-level collaboration. It outlines core principles, functions, and competencies, and introduces a practical Data Stewardship Canvas to support adoption across contexts such as data collaboratives, data spaces, and data commons. Strategic data stewardship, the paper argues, is essential in the age of AI: it translates governance principles into practice, builds trust across data ecosystems, and ensures that data are not only governed, but meaningfully mobilized to serve society."}

In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning.

These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution but faces two critical obstacles: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability. This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning for Creative Storytelling (RLCS) framework to systematically address both challenges. First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality. This work provides a practical pipeline for applying RL to creative domains, effectively navigating the dual challenges of reward modeling and training stability."}

In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67).

Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups."}

However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure.

This study addressed this gap by analyzing all 936 full and short papers published at LAK over a 15-year period using unsupervised machine learning, natural language processing, and network analytics. The analysis revealed a stable core of prolific authors alongside high turnover of newcomers, systematic links between funding sources and research directions, and six enduring topical centers that remain globally shared but vary in prominence across countries. These six topical centers, which encompass LA research, are: self-regulated learning, dashboards and theory, social learning, automated feedback, multimodal analytics, and outcome prediction.

Decentralized Applications (DApps) in distributed systems consist of on-chain and off-chain functions, where on-chain functions are smart contracts running in the blockchain network, while off-chain functions operate outside the blockchain. Since smart contracts cannot access off-chain information, they cannot verify whether the off-chain functions, i.e. the software components, they interact with have been tampered or not. As a result, establishing mutual trust between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain functions remains a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this paper introduces TeeMAF, a generic framework for mutual attestation between on-chain and off-chain functions, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), specifically Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), SCONE (a TEE container on top of Intel SGX), and remote attestation technologies. This ensures that the deployed off-chain functions of a DApp execute in a provably secure computing environment and achieve mutual attestation with the interacting on-chain functions. Through a security analysis of TeeMAF, the reliability of deployed DApps can be verified, ensuring their correct execution. Furthermore, based on this framework, this paper proposes a decentralized resource orchestration platform (a specific DApp) for deploying applications over untrusted environments. The system is implemented on Ethereum and benchmarked using Hyperledger Caliper. Performance evaluation focusing on throughput and latency demonstrates that, compared to platforms without a mutual attestation scheme, the performance overhead remains within an acceptable range."}

Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances.

The gradient--responsibility identity holds exactly; LSE alone collapses; variance prevents dead components; decorrelation prevents redundancy. The model exhibits EM-like optimization dynamics in which lower loss does not correspond to better features and adaptive optimizers offer no advantage. The resulting decoder-free model learns interpretable mixture components, confirming that implicit EM theory can prescribe architectures."}

Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects, social equity, and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of networks, flows, and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current \"as-is\" scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple \"what-if\" scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies."}

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks."}

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology.

The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency.

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction.

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$.

LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences.

Despite recent reforms, it remains unclear whether these frameworks effectively secure Nigeria's digital domain and advance its digital sovereignty amid escalating cross-border cyber threats. Using a multi-method, triangulated qualitative design that combines document analysis, secondary analysis of existing studies, expert insights, and direct observation of cybersecurity developments, the paper assesses how these instruments operate in practice. The Cybercrimes Act (2015, amended 2024) and NCPS (2015, revised 2021) have strengthened Nigeria's commitments to tackling cybercrime, regulating digital activities, and protecting critical infrastructure. Yet persistent gaps remain, including legislative ambiguities, weak enforcement, uneven threat prioritization, limited institutional coordination, and loss of skilled professionals. The paper argues that achieving digital sovereignty will require stronger implementation, sustainable resourcing, workforce retention, and clearer accountability mechanisms to translate policy ambition into tangible and durable security outcomes."}

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents."}

Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) derives visual representations closely matching the database entries. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an SSIM 99.5% matching score in visual outputs, paving the way for next-generation quality control workflows in industry."}

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response."}

We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding."}

Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules. Designed with built-in interpretability, the proposed model also enables better understanding of its predictive behavior, as shown in a case study where it adaptively shifts attention to relevant variables and time intervals during a disruptive event."}

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings."}

This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network. To validate the effectiveness of the MFRD model, we conducted experiments on two data platforms: Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE).

Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale."}

In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning. Specifically, we evaluate: Do existing unlearning methods truly adhere to the original definition of machine unlearning and effectively eliminate all influence of target samples when similar samples are present in the training dataset? Our extensive experiments, conducted on four carefully constructed datasets with thorough analysis, reveal a notable gap between the expected and actual performance of most existing unlearning methods for image and language models, even for the retraining-from-scratch baseline.

To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns.

While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\\times$. This scalability is achieved without compromising accuracy and speed, and in fact reducing latency by 4.12%-23.26%."}

A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed).

In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets.

Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation."}

We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup."}

In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work. Finally, we test the implicit bias inverse-design procedure in notable cases, including biases toward sparsity in linear features or in spectral properties of the model parameters."}

We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow. Function calls for generating these intermediate texts, and for corresponding Python code, ensure that data stays local, and only aggregate statistics and associated instructions are injected into LLM prompts.

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.\n  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence."}

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings."}

Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training."}

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems."}

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance.

While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."}

We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient.

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation.

More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters."}

In educational settings, AI powered systems have become essential for predicting student performance due to their advanced analytical capabilities. However, effectively leveraging diverse student data to uncover latent and complex patterns remains a key challenge. While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end. Our approach outperforms top machine learning models by 4.7% in validation F1 score during the critical early 7% of the semester, underscoring the value of dynamic features and heterogeneous graph representations in student success prediction."}

However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines."}

In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty."}

Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs."}

While the general prediction of such motion for an arbitrary control mechanism is difficult, for a particular choice of control, the dynamics reduces to the Lie-Poisson equations [33,34]. Our goal is to learn the phase-space dynamics and predict the motion solely from observations, without any knowledge of the control Hamiltonian or the nature of interaction between vehicles. To achieve that goal, we propose the Control Optimal Lie-Poisson Neural Networks (CO-LPNets) for learning and predicting the dynamics of the system from data. Our methods learn the mapping of the phase space through the composition of Poisson maps, which are obtained as flows from Hamiltonians that could be integrated explicitly. CO-LPNets preserve the Poisson bracket and thus preserve Casimirs to machine precision. We discuss the completeness of the derived neural networks and their efficiency in approximating the dynamics. To illustrate the power of the method, we apply these techniques to systems of $N=3$ particles evolving on ${\\rm SO}(3)$ group, which describe coupled rigid bodies rotating about their center of mass, and ${\\rm SE}(3)$ group, applicable to the movement of unmanned air and water vehicles.

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents."}

In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors."}

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users.

ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations."}

This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context.

As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. In addition, to validate the effect of OES, I conduct experiments using different GNNs on two datasets. The results show that OES can empirically outperform backbone models in both shallow and deep architectures while also reducing training time."}

Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data.

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction."}

A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee."}

In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies."}

In contrast, affordable hardware is low-cost but constrained by memory capacity and bandwidth, making it unsuitable for direct LLM training. To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs. Experiments show that our method matches or even surpasses full-parameter training in performance across multiple downstream tasks, loss function, and perplexity (PPL), while reducing training cost by 47.6 percent to 69.5 percent on Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B and Llama-MoE-3.5B across different datasets."}

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration."}

This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity.

However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning. By integrating the generative capability of diffusion models with the semantic understanding of MLLMs, our approach provides a robust and generalizable automated augmentation strategy for training MLLMs without any human annotation or additional supervision."}

Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang & Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing robust performance not only in realizable settings but also in scenarios with model misspecification."}

Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this \"Axioms-as-Layers\" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail."}

Our framework integrates compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model, enabling real-time uncertainty quantification via Query-by-Committee. We systematically compare four selection strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach balancing both objectives. Experiments across four representative material systems (elemental carbon, silicon, iron, and a titanium-oxide compound) with 5 random seeds per configuration demonstrate that diversity sampling consistently achieves competitive or superior performance, with particularly strong advantages on complex systems like titanium-oxide (10.9% improvement, p=0.008). Our results show that intelligent data selection strategies can achieve target accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples compared to random baselines. The entire pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB of RAM, thereby democratizing MLIP development for researchers globally with limited computational resources.

The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency. Despite advancements, significant research gaps persist in practically understanding the legal limits of AI evidence in judicial processes. Existing literature lacks focused assessment of the evidentiary value of AI outputs. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction. The paper emphasizes the necessity of independent validation and, development of AI-specific admissibility criteria. Findings inform policy development for the responsible AI integration within criminal justice systems.

Although extensive research has focused on developing efficient machine unlearning strategies, we argue that these methods mainly aim at removing samples rather than removing samples' influence on the model, thus overlooking the fundamental definition of machine unlearning. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning. Specifically, we evaluate: Do existing unlearning methods truly adhere to the original definition of machine unlearning and effectively eliminate all influence of target samples when similar samples are present in the training dataset? Our extensive experiments, conducted on four carefully constructed datasets with thorough analysis, reveal a notable gap between the expected and actual performance of most existing unlearning methods for image and language models, even for the retraining-from-scratch baseline.

These systems employ safety mechanisms to prevent disallowed actions, including the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images. While single-turn refusals are expected, the interaction between safety filters and conversation-level state is not well understood. This study documents a reproducible behavioral effect in the ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) web interface. Manual execution was chosen to capture the exact user-facing safety behavior of the production system, rather than isolated API components. When a conversation begins with an uploaded copyrighted image and a request to remove a watermark, which the model correctly refuses, subsequent prompts to generate unrelated, benign images are refused for the remainder of the session. Importantly, text-only requests (e.g., generating a Python function) continue to succeed. Across 40 manually run sessions (30 contaminated and 10 controls), contaminated threads showed 116/120 image-generation refusals (96.67%), while control threads showed 0/40 refusals (Fisher's exact p < 0.0001). All sessions used an identical fixed prompt order, ensuring sequence uniformity across conditions. We describe this as safety-state persistence: a form of conversational over-generalization in which a copyright refusal influences subsequent, unrelated image-generation behavior. We present these findings as behavioral observations, not architectural claims. We discuss possible explanations, methodological limitations (single model, single interface), and implications for multimodal reliability, user experience, and the design of session-level safety systems. These results motivate further examination of session-level safety interactions in multimodal AI systems."}

Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited.

We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vector Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quantization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP).

In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning.

We also argue that AI Slop is not mere digital detritus but has its own aesthetic value. Like other \"low\" cultural forms initially dismissed by critics, it nonetheless offers a legitimate means of collective sense-making, with the potential to express meaning and identity. We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right."}

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset. This work advances the field of molecular imaging by demonstrating the potential of AI-driven radiogenomics for precision oncology, supporting non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in GBM."}

Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement.

While these systems promise major gains in productivity, they also raise new ethical challenges. Prior research has examined how different populations prioritize Responsible AI values, yet little is known about how practitioners actually reason through the trade-offs inherent in designing these autonomous systems. This paper investigates the ethical reasoning of AI practitioners through qualitative interviews centered on structured dilemmas in agentic AI deployment. We find that the responses of practitioners do not merely reflect value preferences but rather align with three distinct reasoning frameworks. First is a Customer-Centric framework where choices are justified by business interests, legality, and user autonomy. Second is a Design-Centric framework emphasizing technical safeguards and system constraints. Third is an Ethics-Centric framework prioritizing social good and moral responsibility beyond compliance. We argue that these frameworks offer distinct and necessary insights for navigating ethical trade-offs. Consequently, providers of agentic AI must look beyond general principles and actively manage how these diverse reasoning frameworks are represented in their decision-making processes to ensure robust ethical outcomes."}

Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: \"When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?\" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples. Overall, these results argue for incorporating safety signals early in pretraining, producing models that are more robust to downstream finetuning and jailbreaking, and more reliable under both standard and safety-aware inference procedures."}

This study evaluates the environmental footprint of AI server operations and examines feasible technological and infrastructural strategies to mitigate these impacts. Using a literature-based methodology supported by quantitative projections and case-study analysis, we assessed trends in global electricity consumption, cooling-related water use, and carbon emissions. Projections indicate that global data center electricity demand may increase from approximately 415 TWh in 2024 to nearly 945 TWh by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for a disproportionate share of this growth. In the United States alone, AI servers are expected to drive annual increases in water consumption of 200--300 billion gallons and add 24--44 million metric tons of CO2 quivalent emissions by 2030. The results show that the design of the cooling system and the geographic location influence the environmental impact as strongly as the efficiency of the hardware. Advanced cooling technologies can reduce cooling energy by up to 50%, while location in low-carbon and water-secure regions can cut combined footprints by nearly half. In general, the study concludes that sustainable AI expansion requires coordinated improvements in cooling efficiency, renewable energy integration, and strategic deployment decisions."}

Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms."}

Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence.

Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties.

While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines."}

However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that FLORA achieves rapid adaptation and meta-policy improvement compared to baselines across various environments."}

We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities.

However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that \\r{ho} serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-\\r{ho} layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training."}

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are widely used for interpretation.

We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets. A financial case study shows that GS-SHAP identifies interpretable multivariate-temporal interactions among key market variables during high-volatility regimes."}

This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration. The complete training and evaluation pipeline, implemented efficiently through Low-Rank Adaptation, is released to facilitate further research."}

Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users. Given sparse and noisy user annotations, L2CU identifies representative annotator profiles capturing distinct labeling patterns. By matching unseen users to these profiles, L2CU leverages profile-specific models to complement the user and achieve superior joint accuracy. We evaluate L2CU on datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang and AgNews), demonstrating its effectiveness as a model-agnostic solution for improving human-AI cooperative classification."}

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines."}

In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.

Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation."}

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(Σ_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $Σ_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $Σ_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs."}

Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases."}

However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization."}

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains.

However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion.

We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits.

Silvia Ruiz-España and Laura Arnal contributed equally to this work", "summary": "The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making."}

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training."}

Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal. We release standardized dataset splits and model weights to enable reproducible benchmarking.

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance."}

Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs."}

Artificial intelligence gave rise to social media bots that can spread conspiracies in an automated fashion. Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes. These results have implications for designing communication strategies to maintain a healthy social cyber ecosystem."}

Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training"}

The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe.

As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs."}

Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable."}

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset.

Firstly, we consider the direct environmental impact of AI from a top-down approach, starting from general information and communication technologies (ICT) and then zooming in on data centers and the different phases of AI development and deployment. Secondly, a framework is introduced on how to assess both the direct and indirect impact of AI. Finally, we finish with good practices and what we can do to reduce AI impact."}

MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions. We release our code for reproducibility."}

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems."}

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation."}

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios."}

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated."}

MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol.

However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant ."}

Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort.

We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$).

However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.\n  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.\n  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection."}

Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels."}

We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance.

This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance."}

Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively."}

However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges."}

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty."}

This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95\\%, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches.

We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes.

The paper argues that safe agent autonomy must be achieved through progressive validation, analogous to the staged development of autonomous driving, rather than through immediate full automation. Transparency and accountability are identified as foundational requirements for establishing user trust and for mitigating known risks in generative AI systems, including hallucinations, data bias, and goal misalignment, such as the inversion problem. The paper further describes three ongoing work streams supporting this framework: public deliberation on AI agents conducted by the Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab, cross-industry collaboration through the Safe AI Agent Consortium, and the development of open tooling for an agent operating environment aligned with the Three-Pillar Model.

Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference.

To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework."}

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.\n  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems"}

We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense α-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth. We argue that these continuous diagnostics offer a bridge between high-level behavioral evaluation and low-level representational dynamics, contributing to the cognitive interpretability of LLMs. Lastly, we provide a CLI and datasets for various cognitive behaviors at the project repository, https://github.com/shimamooo/CBMAS."}

We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training."}

In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of ML applied to remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. Specifically, we aim to 1) estimate the average performance; 2) determine the degree of heterogeneity between and within studies; and 3) assess how study features influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed across multiple academic databases to identify potentially relevant studies. A random sample of 200 was screened by three reviewers, resulting in 86 trials within 20 studies with 14 study features. Overall accuracy was the most reported performance metric. It was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the best model was 0.90 [0.86, 0.92]. There was considerable heterogeneity in model performance, 64% of which was between studies. The only significant feature was the prevalence of the majority class, which explained 61% of the between-study heterogeneity. None of the other thirteen features added value to the model. The most important contributions of this paper are the following two insights. 1) Overall accuracy is the most popular performance metric, yet arguably the least insightful. Its sensitivity to class imbalance makes it necessary to normalize it, which is far from common practice. 2) The field needs to standardize the reporting. Reporting of the confusion matrix for independent test sets is the most important ingredient for between-study comparisons of ML classifiers. These findings underscore the need for robust and comparable evaluation metrics in machine learning applications to ensure reliable and actionable insights for effective SDG monitoring and policy formulation."}

Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence.

The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling.

While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows.

We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations."}

The attackers exploit this method to manipulate individuals into revealing their confidential data. Recently, we see the colorful and fancy representations of QR codes, the 2D matrix of QR codes which does not reflect a typical mixture of black-white modules anymore. Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce \"ALFA\", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes. Our method first converts a fancy QR code into the replica of binary grid and then identify the erroneous representation of modules in that grid. Following that, we present \"FAST\" method which can conveniently recover erroneous modules from that binary grid. Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only. We also develop the mobile app to test the practical feasibility of our solution and provide a performance comparison of the app with the real-world QR readers. This comparison further highlights the classification reliability and detection accuracy of this solution in real-world environments."}

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks."}

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation."}

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction."}

LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences.

Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules. Designed with built-in interpretability, the proposed model also enables better understanding of its predictive behavior, as shown in a case study where it adaptively shifts attention to relevant variables and time intervals during a disruptive event."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a robust LLM-RL framework with HITL support for cloud defense. We will release our framework to the community, facilitating the advancement of robust and autonomous defense in cloud networks."}

However, their application to Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) -- a typical scenario in energy systems -- remains largely unexplored. Considering the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of the load data, effectively utilizing the powerful modeling capabilities of diffusion models to enhance STELF accuracy remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network. To validate the effectiveness of the MFRD model, we conducted experiments on two data platforms: Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE).

This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."}

We then leverage such an approximation to propose HELVAE, a multimodal VAE that avoids sub-sampling, yielding an efficient yet effective model that: (i) learns more expressive latent representations as additional modalities are observed; and (ii) empirically achieves better trade-offs between generative coherence and quality, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure.

A Factorial Analysis Methodology for Diagnosing the Trade-off between Preference Alignment and Real-World Validity", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts."}

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$.

We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow.

We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup."}

As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs."}

Submitted to arXiv as a preprint", "summary": "Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms."}

In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity.

Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."}

Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training."}

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction."}

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance. This research provides a generalized and interpretable model for real-time evacuation traffic forecasting, with significant implications for evacuation traffic management."}

Employing a case study of a university's computer science department, the paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based optimization model, which is solved using the Gurobi solver. The objective is to minimize the number of classrooms used by prioritizing the assignment of PwD students to ground-floor classrooms to reduce accessibility barriers. The model is calibrated with a weighting parameter, alpha, that allows for a balance between spatial efficiency and promoting accessibility. Experimental results indicate that adjusting alpha can achieve a balance point that significantly improves current manual allocation practices, reducing the number of classrooms required and accessibility penalties. The findings suggest that optimization methods can improve operational efficiency in academic institutions while promoting a more inclusive environment for all students.

We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences. We evaluate our approach on multiple new bacterial diagnostics to separate tasks and models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences.

We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty."}

From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors."}

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute.

As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach.

Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy. Overall, WFR-FM establishes a unified and efficient paradigm for learning dynamical systems from unbalanced snapshots, where not only states but also mass evolve over time."}

In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies."}

To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering.

However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning.

This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness.

However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B).

This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions.

Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement.

In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow.

Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration. The complete training and evaluation pipeline, implemented efficiently through Low-Rank Adaptation, is released to facilitate further research."}

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines."}

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."}

This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques.

We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem.

This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making."}

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training."}

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance."}

Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training"}

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%."}

As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs."}

To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics.

Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels.

Picard", "John Guttag"], "title": "Improving Domain Generalization in Contrastive Learning using Adaptive Temperature Control", "comment": "NeurIPS SSL Workshop 2023", "summary": "Self-supervised pre-training with contrastive learning is a powerful method for learning from sparsely labeled data. However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure."}

DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care. The source code and trained model weights for DT-ICU are publicly available at https://github.com/GUO-W/DT-ICU-release."}
