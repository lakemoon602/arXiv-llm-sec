Drawing on\nActor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines\n-- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI\nagents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely\nas a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency\nencompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the\nliterature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of\nmulti-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels\nthrough which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or\ncriminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant\ntheoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will\nsimply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to\nexplain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between\nautonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected\nfirst? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing?

This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation.

This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model\nthat has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on\ncompetition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was\npre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on\n4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model\nwas then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to\nreach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks.

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions.

The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how\ncollaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process."}

Traditional\nconcurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization\nproblem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell\nboundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures\nfrom a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require\nadditional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we\npropose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a\ncontinuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly\naddressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural\nrepresentation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and\nlocal (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that\nrepresents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across\nthe domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility\nloss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.\nOnce trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high\nresolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical\nmetamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems\nwith potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace."}

Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling.

In this\nstudy, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language\nModels (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code\ntranslation, and commit message generation. We observed that different\nCode-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation,\nAdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA,\nCompacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion\nperformed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that\nthe other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation,\nAdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap\nmarginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code\ngeneration, other PEFT methods showed better performance."}

Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference.

For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,\nour framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with\nstatistical validity."}

Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise\nof multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring."}

In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance.

Using\nautomated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against\nsingle-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings\nreveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all tested models, with multi-turn\nattacks achieving success rates between 25.86\\% and 92.78\\% -- representing a\n$2\\times$ to $10\\times$ increase over single-turn baselines. These results\nunderscore a systemic inability of current open-weight models to maintain\nsafety guardrails across extended interactions. We assess that alignment\nstrategies and lab priorities significantly influence resilience:\ncapability-focused models such as Llama 3.3 and Qwen 3 demonstrate higher\nmulti-turn susceptibility, whereas safety-oriented designs such as Google Gemma\n3 exhibit more balanced performance.\n  The analysis concludes that open-weight models, while crucial for innovation,\npose tangible operational and ethical risks when deployed without layered\nsecurity controls. These findings are intended to inform practitioners and\ndevelopers of the potential risks and the value of professional AI security\nsolutions to mitigate exposure. Addressing multi-turn vulnerabilities is\nessential to ensure the safe, reliable, and responsible deployment of\nopen-weight LLMs in enterprise and public domains. We recommend adopting a\nsecurity-first design philosophy and layered protections to ensure resilient\ndeployments of open-weight models."}
