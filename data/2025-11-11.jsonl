Existing approaches\neither solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep\nlearning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important\nquestion is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based\nconstraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we\naffirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called\nNeural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as\nNCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of\nattribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and\nexternal) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC\nextracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the\nproposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the\ncommunity search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community\nthrough sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing\nhigh-quality results.

This\npaper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day\nvulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public\ncode, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates\nvulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact\nanalysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not\nincorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162\nrepositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their\ndevelopment histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one\nvulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356\n___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we\nmanually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities,\ndemonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach."}

To address these issues, we propose two distinct and\ncomplementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging\nenvironment-specific information available during deployment.

We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,\nincluding function calling and web navigation.

Yet effective, scalable approaches for\nteaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for\nstudents outside STEM fields.\n  To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum\nthat introduces core AI concepts through scenario - based activities set in\nreal - world contexts. This study presents findings from four focus groups with\ninstructors who engaged with AI User materials and participated in structured\nfeedback activities. Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued\nexploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered\nexperimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding,\naccessibility, and multi-modal support.
